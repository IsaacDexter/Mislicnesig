*This item appears as a pair of glass plates screwed together, with a thin layer of turbulent water inside. Glimpses of sizable fish deep below the surface can be caught from time to time, and faint sounds of torrential downpour can be heard from within. This product was the second of its kind that the wizard [[Fulbairn]] attempted to market, and had significantly better sales than its predecessor, [[Fulbairn's Folding Ford]].*
___
As an action, a creature can unscrew the two plates. A seemingly impossible cascade of water will travel from one plate into the other, arcing several feet through the air in otherwise impossible ways to accomplish this feat. The torrent will not avoid movable objects such as creatures or bracken, but will bend to avoid sturdy objects such as walls and boulders. The stream will cease if the source is moved in such a way that the arc would have to extend more than 50 feet.
The water within the falls is clean, cool and fresh, and can be used to refill canteens, clean clothes, and wash oneself. Occasionally, fish will fall through the shower, which can be of reasonable size to eat. Such a supply of fish can be exhausted through overfishing, such as leaving a static net in the wake for too long.
The two plates can be screwed back together as an action, and put up little resistance when doing so. The item can then be stored once more.
