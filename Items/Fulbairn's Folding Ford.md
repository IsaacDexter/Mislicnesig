*Seemingly a wad of wet translucent parchment, the sounds of a babbling brook can be heard when this is held to the ear. Ripples of current can be felt while this is held. The wizard [[Fulbairn]] attempted to market this to outdoorsmen, but had poor sales thanks to the general distrust of magic amongst yokels. The product  was eventually succeeded by [[Fulbairn's Collapsible Cascade]].*
___
It takes 1 minute to unfold the folding brook, upon which it unfurls into a 20 yard shallow brook that seemingly emerges from under the ground at the upstream end and returns underground at the opposite end. 
The brook is clean, cool, and fast flowing, and seems alive with small fish.The brook is shallow enough to pass through with ease, and at intervals contains stepping stones to allow passage without feet getting wet.
To try and refold the brook is significantly more difficult. It can be done by non-magical means, but is difficult and requires a DC15 Dexterity Check. Alternatively, certain spells such as shape water can be used to assist in the folding, at the DMs discretion.
