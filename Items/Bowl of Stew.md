A Bowl of Stew that has the words “speak “Stew”, and Stew shall appear.” Engraved upon its outer edge in Dwarvish. Speaking the command will summon a small imp named Stew who is imprisoned within the bowl until he has completed your request to the best of his ability, while within the confines of the bowl. The command word works multiple times a day but stew is unwilling to help if pestered too frequently.
