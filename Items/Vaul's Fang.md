- An embezzled dagger wreathed in engravings of horned beasts, this weapon was passed unto St. Vaul by [[Gelwaré]] when she made him her champion of the wilds. Those who would use this weapon to hunt for sport shalt surely face Vaul’s judgement.
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
- You can use an action to cause the blade to glow with bestial retribution. The glow remains for 1 round and affects all attacks using this weapon against a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 piercing damage and become deafened for 1 minute, believing themselves to hear the clamorous roars of the beasts under Vaul's protection. The dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
- Hunting a beast without need (Vaul’s discretion) angers [[Gelwaré#Saint Vaul]], and renders this weapon powerless to the wielder. Such transgressions shall not be forgiven lightly.
- Proficiency with a dagger allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.
- Found in the basement of [[Molan#The Gaske Tumn Museum of Gallantry and Heroism]].
