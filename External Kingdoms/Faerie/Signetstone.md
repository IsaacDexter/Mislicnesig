* Rare and precious mother-of-pearl-like stone found underground in [[Faerie]].
* Retains the same lustre all inside as well as all over, and can be found in large quantities, even to the size of boulders.
* Infuriates mining dwellers of [[Mislicnesig]], who believe the stone far more abundant than the fairies realise, as fairies never host mining operations of any real size.
* Most of the supply of Signetstone in [[Mislicnesig]] was in the possession of [[The Prince Under Starlight]], used as a barter good from his fey allies.
* They adorned the walls of his palace, twinkling from the starlight and moonlight that streamed in through the open roof, acting as stars themselves.
* More of the stone was gifted in the form of signet rings to his lords during [[Reign of Starlight]], and fought over during [[The Blinking]], as it denoted noble lineage - many modern day rulers rule holding a Signetstone ring their family fashioned, stole, or were bequeathed.
* Forgery rings were crafted of the stars on the walls of [[WƒÅg Gleomu]], so folks could claim noble lineage and stake their claim in the turbulent civil war that followed the princes disappearance.
* Some of the stone was brought over during the [[Hollytide]], where it was worn as pendants and rings by the invading force.
* Little of these artefacts remain in [[Mislicnesig]], many were originally magical or have been enchanted since.
* All are treated as most prized treasures indeed.
* Aside from other tiny imports over the years, the final import was performed without the public's knowledge by [[Red Mollie]], when she gifted it to [[The Revenant]] to assist in her plans of designing a deity
