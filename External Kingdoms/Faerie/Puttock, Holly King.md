* An ancient [[Archfey]] king from years before The [[Reign of Starlight]], Puttock was an innately very powerful magic user who led armies of both Fey clad in green spiked armour, and animate bushes of Holly across [[Faerie]] to claim his throne.
* He gained his title as a result of the armies he raised to claim his first kingdom, which were animate bushes of holly.
* His later fey soldiers were clad in Green spiked armour to avoid it being clear who was fey and who bush.
* After conquering much of [[Faerie]], Puttock led his armies into the material plane, through those of [[The Routes Between]] that occurred naturally. This furthered his conquest, and he conquered much of the southern regions, thus starting the [[Hollytide]].
* It is though, however, that he did not care for [[Mislicnesig]], as he spent almost no time there after his conquest, and instead returned to [[Faerie]].
* His kingdoms never technically left his rule, instead they quickly fell into disuse by his own folk and were eventually turned into other kingdoms.
* The king never studied magic and had not made himself immortal - he was eventually killed by his own children and his kingdoms carved up between them, to eventually fall into obscurity following the conquering of others.
* His half-fey children followed on in his warlike nature, but remained within [[Faerie]], some died heirless in wars, others gripped onto the kingdoms they snatched for generations.
* [[Fairies]]' views on lineage makes it difficult to determine if any of Puttockâ€™s bloodline is around today.
