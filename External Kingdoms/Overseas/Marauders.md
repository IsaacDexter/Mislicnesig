* Pirate-like scoundrels who roam the coasts of [[Mislicnesig]].
* Some are good, keeping their countries shores safe from enormous sea beasts and selling the remains.
* Some are neutral, looting treasure from shipwrecks and burying it to pocket later.
* Some are evil, plundering innocent merchant vessels for all their worth.
* They carve their figureheads in the likeness of their gods, either the god of their homelands or the god of the high seas, [[Marin]].
