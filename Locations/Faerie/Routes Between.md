#location
* Shallow streams and canals cultivated by [[The Starlit Prince]] and his fairy allies to allow safe passage into [[Fairyland]], and subsequently across [[Mislicnesig]] undetected
* Some form naturally, the vast majority were intentionally cultivated by [[The Starlit Prince]] during the [[Reign of Starlight]].
* [[Gaebyryen]] and other fairy plants often grow at the spouts of these routes.
* The routes sometimes still work though not always, and are often avoided by the common man, as [[Fairyland]] is seen as a dangerous place.
* Can be waded or ridden in boats - during the height of the kings rule, special boats were constructed which granted consistent and safe passage.
* Charms were also made which granted safe travel.
* Such charms now are rare and little known except by the world of high magic, such as the professors at [[The Three Colleges#Weolcantam]].
