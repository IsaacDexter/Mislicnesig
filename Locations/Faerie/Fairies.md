## Fairy Lineage
* Mortals often keep surnames, houses or broods, but fairies rarely observe such lineage, and prefer to be seen as self made individuals, regardless of their starting point.
* Fairies often claim to be infinitely old when they can, in fact, be quite young, and almost never admit their inheritances or obstacles brought about by their predecessors.
