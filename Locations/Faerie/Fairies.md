# Language
Sylvan refers to a family of dialects spoken by the residents of Fairyland. The tongue is convoluted, contradictory, and context-dependent. Objects are typically identified using compound words rather than a single noun, leading to a great deal of both synonyms and homophones. This makes deciphering meaning incredibly reliant on context and tone. This makes misleading, tongue-in-cheek, and veiled language very easy to achieve, but equally difficult to discern - perfect for fairies, who are able to pass off insults and lies as mere misinterpretations. Essentially, **Fairy language is built to facilitate deception, insults, and mischief.** The true answer to a given query is typically divulged, but in such a way that finding it is a puzzle of its own.

Sylvan has a written form, but it is seldom used. Fairies do not keep records, and consistently lie to bolster themselves and cover their tracks - records would make validating these lies easier, something fairies strive against. Riddles and satirical prose are the only forms of literature fairies typically engage in.
# Society
## Aristocracy
While the idea of effectively ruling a fairy community may seem preposterous, fairies hold an elaborate system of leadership, according to descendance from noble bloodlines. Unfortunately, fairies' promiscuous and deceitful nature makes tracking and verifying lineage next to impossible. **All fairies claim nobility.** Validity of these claims is unverifiable, so is instead judged solely on decorum: **If a fairy behaves as nobility (condescending and arrogant), their subjects will treat them with according reverence (backhanded flattery and indolence).**
# Behaviour
Fairies live an extraordinary amount of time, and lack the ambition that drives mortals to achieve great things. They are hedonistic, egotistic; some are cruel. They do not devote their lives to any purpose, they live on whims and take no accountability. They tire quickly of material possessions, and do not maintain them. Although status and prestige are desirable, fairies are fickle and two-faced, making respect hard to obtain and harder to maintain. While some fairies pursue the arts, especially comedy, theatre, and riddles, mischief is a fairy's primary pursuit. 

Fairies are troublemakers; they crave mayhem and reject order at any opportunity. Because of their comparatively fleeting lives, mortal folk are seen as insignificant, and are the primary prey of fairy schemes and pranks. Mortals are rarely able to get comeuppance, so sleights against them are seen as inconsequential, making them apt victims.
## Magic
Unlike mortals, who have to study or invent spells, Fairies possess a natural affinity for magic, although they do not cast spells in the conventional sense. Rather, they are able to achieve magical effects through physical and mental exertion, bounded only by the caster's imagination and clarity of thought. Physical craftmanship is severely underdeveloped as a result: Why should one labour to learn the skills necessary to work silk into a majestic cloak, or to temper steel into a handsome sword, when magic can effortlessly create the illusion of such craftmanship?
# Appearance
Fairies are diverse and numerous in species and appearance.
- Sprites are tiny, winged troublemakers.
- Satyrs are goatlike revellers.
- Dryads are slender wood spirits who enjoy leading travellers astray.
- The Seelie are human-sized, courting, ethereal fairies possessing manners and decorum, reminiscent of Titania and Oberon.
- The Unseelie are The Seelie's malicious counterparts.
- Pixies are sprite-like, but more civilized
- Hags are witchy creatures, reminiscent of Macbeth's witches.
Species correlates to, but does not define class or behaviour.
# Fairyland
Fairyland, also known as The Otherworld or The Marches, is an mysterious land, inaccessible by normal means. However, fairies are able to easily travel between the two worlds. The boundaries between the two worlds grow thin in certain areas, known as Places Between. Otherworldly influence is much stronger in these areas.

Signetstone is an extremely valuable jewel found only in Fairyland. Gaebyryen, or Gayberries, grow wild in Fairyland, and are used in the manufacture of Fairy Wine. Various creatures and monsters unknown to our world roam freely in the other, and often posses magical abilities.
