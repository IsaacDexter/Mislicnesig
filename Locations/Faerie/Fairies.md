# Fairy Lineage
* Mortals often keep surnames, houses or broods, but fairies rarely observe such lineage, and prefer to be seen as self made individuals, regardless of their starting point.
* Fairies often claim to be infinitely old when they can, in fact, be quite young, and almost never admit their inheritances or obstacles brought about by their predecessors.
# Fairy Language
Fairy language (formally, Sylvan) is a contradictory tongue full of idiosyncrasies. It contains a great deal of homophones, especially between objects sharing similar traits: for example, *gnarled wood*, *injury*, and *minced words* all share a single noun. The language is abundant with simile and metaphor; very little is said plainly. Deciphering meaning, therefore, is highly dependent on knowledge of the speaker, their intentions, and context. Therefore, speaking and transliterating the language is not uniquely difficult, but discerning truth and intent from a conversation or passage is a rare and unique feat amongst those who dwell outside of Fairyland.

# The Fairy Aristocracy
While the idea of effectively ruling a fairy may seem preposterous, fairies hold an elaborate system of aristocratic bloodlines. Unfortunately, fairies' whorey nature makes tracking and verifying bloodlines next to impossible.
