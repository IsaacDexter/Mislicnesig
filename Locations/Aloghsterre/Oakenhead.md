#location
* Decently sized village about 25 miles south from [[Aloghsterre]], connected by [[Aberfwyn#Aberfwyn Road]] as it winds from the eastern coast.
* Host of [[#Leaden Pack Day]].
# Consorts' Day
* Springtime festival with focus on fertility.
* Drinking magic merriment .
* In honour of the false prince .
* They make a procession where they bring a virgin to the opening of a route between.
* Later they come back and she is gone, [[Fairy Wine]] and strange goodies lie in her place .
* These are taken back to the village and merriment continues this time with everyone tripping balls.
* Most of the young lovers elope to a nearby hill in the may air .
* Children and parents and old folk stay in the town .
* Children dress in cloaks with goat skulls atop them and chide young folk who are without a lover and ask for currants and shit .
* But big focus on the fact you aren't on the hill .
* Eventually [[Fairies]] wearing the cloaks arrive but the cloaks are too long and the goat skulls are not picked clean right, they stink and you can't imagine how bad it smells under the cloak .
* They charm you to go to the hill where dozens and dozens of the cloaked figures are, with seemingly none of the lovers you expected .
* In reality the festival is for [[Ayle Hermand]] to get maidens to use to build alliances within [[Fairyland]] as a pawn for [[Red Mollie]].
* I haven't figured out what the cloaked figures are doing, I think its fairy mischief where they're trying to kidnap lovers and steal their future children to swap them with changelings and other weird stuff .
* Eerily beautiful androgynous rider organised everyone into a dance maybe dancing the whole night for him to find another to wed?
* All the people so tired but each time they dance with a fae they receive a strange energy that doesn't rejuvenate just makes them forget their tiredness for a spell.
* Forge your own sword with the blacksmith.
* Palmistry.
* Some sort of hunting or adventuring activities.
* Perhaps a gang of young raucous folks wish to bring a dire wolf to the platter, and such must be hunted, or steal some trophy from the next village over.
* Carving faces into the trees in the coppices nearby and asking them questions with the kids as divination.
* Some sort of race?
* Blood portraits - A drow woman with a parasol offers to paint your likeness - first she needs to know the subject and asks you to lay you hand open on the table to read your palm, which she does, and then she pricks your finger and mixes some of your blood into the red paint, without any warning. She does a great portrait of you in some sort of unusual and dire situation, such as on a sinking ship, a crumbling precipice or such, and charges only a little 
## Tarot Reading
* Have a tarot reading at the opening fair, that teases [[The Starlit Prince]]'s continued existence; [[Aln the Mad]] and the gods influence; the deceivers presence in [[Oakenhead]]; and lastly, a false card, the queen of holly. This the reader says she has never seen before, in all her years of reading, and bequeaths the deck unto the party member who received this reading.
* If the reader tries to count all the cards, bought can be done, they lose count. To try and write all of the cards down leaves them in a script you don't recognise (little used fairy script) to comprehend languages does in fact list cards additional to the core set, including bones, stars, holly and crosses as additional minor arcana, and additional major arcana also such as the throne, the river, the vineyard. 
* Once per day, a player may make a reading, wherein the dm reveals which card they draw which best describes the coming day to the best of their knowledge, giving vague answers to vague days.
* Thinking of using/making an actual tarot set and mocking up my own card for the queen of holly reveal, perhaps with green holly shapes? Would certainly set up [[Red Mollie]] with a bang.
