#location 
Larlen is a ruin, a broken town along the toad between [[Oakenhead]] and [[Aloghsterre]] that has been since converted into [[#Goblin University]]. It flourished once, under a vampiric rule built around the worship of [[#Theth]], an old religious practice centred around the sanctity of blood: that which babes are born of. Larlen was not alone in this worship, and the worship was old, but Larlen was a flourishing town, not a druidic circle.

Elsewhere, emphasis began to be placed on Ichor, the blood of the gods, following the rise of vampiric warlock cults in the frozen north, who sought to bleed gods to empower themselves. The gods took a swift and harsh approach to blood-worship. Vampires were hunted, cults were snuffed and cities were burnt to bedrock by enraged zealots.

Larlen was razed to ruins, The Mother, Theth, set to hang, caged, at a crossroads, her humiliating epitaph barely sustaining her faith. There she idled, waning and bleeding, for decades.
# Theth
Decades have passed since Theth's humiliation. All of her followers are dead, but the strength of her will, fuelled by the hatred at her own cage being her temple, has enabled them to live on. They haunt the grounds of Larlen, and consequently the university, driven by spite. They dislike the goblin's desecration of their home, but have been driven to hate and outright sabotage the goblins following the stealing of Theth's plaque.

The restless spirits have been haunting the goblins to little effect. Goblins are imperceptive, and rarely notice anything but a major spectacle. They lack the cognitive abilities to relate the ghost's behaviours to their own.

The sprits see the party's presence as an opportunity. They are in dire straits: all that sustains their god lies in the hands of the illiterate, who wish to feed it to a rust monster. The party is competent, but the spirits panic seeing the party holding the plaque, so spring the trap they had in store for the goblins, but spring it hastily and poorly, potentially endangering the very thing they seek to protect.

They send the pile of scrap in the arena flying everywhere; one hurtles into the cage of the rust monster, Crusher. Crusher has been trained well - he sees non-goblins in his cage, and engages on the offense. Even a specimen such as he is no match for the party, however, and falls, his blood trickling into the umber soil. The spirits take the opportunity before them, evoking the remainder of Theth's power: Crusher is reanimated, his ferrous blood flowing around the outside of him. It is dead, it ignores metal, it wants only for the plaque.

When it eventually falls, the spirits do not withdraw. Fuelled by the energy and awe of the goblins, they are whipped into a frenzy. A blood god seems perfect for purposeless goblins.
# Goblin University
Long after the abandonment of the town, the manor and surrounding grounds began to be squatted by a conglomeration between three neighbouring goblin tribes, the Caw Caws; Knitters; and Red Rocks, who dwelled in caves shared by rust monsters and appeased them by pilfering scrap metal. They converted the manor into a 'University', specializing in educating bandits and low folk in matters related to their craft.

The university is non-hostile to outsiders, hoping to enroll them as prospective students. They offer a variety of suitably Goblin courses:
- How to tell which birds you can eat from the sounds they make
- How to knit clothes
- How to make weapons out of metal
- Breaking cave creatures
- Butchering creatures that talk
- Stealing small things
- Stealing big things

The University has three main fraternities, formed of the three goblin tribes who founded and make up the bulk of the university. The Red Rocks have centered their fraternity around arena combat between rust monsters and other creatures. In preparation of a championship, they have stripped much of the metal out of the town and the surrounding area, including the signpost at the crossroads.
## Arena
The goblins, especially the red rocks, have converted an old amphitheatre and sacred site into a crude arena. Foolhardy goblins, beasts and unfortunate souls battle frequently against ferocious rust monsters, while other goblins gather for the spectacle, placing bets and carousing.
### Crusher
The champion of the arena is [[#Crusher]], trained by [[#Gary]], a member of the Red Rocks. He is a ferocious and formidable rock monster. He has been immaculately trained so as to be hostile to any unfamiliar face who enters the ring.
### Gary
Gary is meticulous, proud, and talented at training animals. He is bitter towards the party once they kill Crusher, and attempts 

# Crossroads
The crossroads are the final resting place of [[Theth]], who is rotting in a cage suspended over the road in an act of humiliation and undeath.

The Goblins at the university have stolen the signpost and the plaque at the foot of Theth's cage, intending to feed it to Crusher, the champion rock monster of the arena.
___
A painter, [[#Ness]], is visiting the crossroads at the same time as the party. She knows the way to the capital, but feigns ignorance to prompt the party to find Larlen for her as she paints. 
## Ness
Ness hails from refugees who fled Larlen at it's razing and settled in [[Dederlic]]. Her parents hid their faith from her and all others, fearing persecution. She only found out following her own investigations, and seeks to uncover the truth about the town. She is not a fanatic, she just seeks answers. She has taken up painting as a means to finance her travels across the country, and loves it.
