#location 
Larlen is a ruin, a broken town along the toad between [[Oakenhead]] and [[Aloghsterre]]. It flourished once, under a vampiric rule built around the worship of [[Theth]], an old religous practice centred around the sancity of blood: that which babes are born of. Larlen was not alone in this worship, and the worship was old, but Larlen was a flourishing town, not a druidic circle.

Elsewhere, emphasis began to be placed on Ichor, the blood of the gods, following the rise of vampiric warlock cults in the frozen north, who sought to bleed gods to empower themselves. The gods took a swift and harsh approach to blood-worship. Vampires were hunted, cults were snuffed and cities were burnt to bedrock by enraged zealots.

Larlen was razed to ruins, The Mother, Thoth, set to hang, caged, at a crossroads, her humiliating epitath barely sustaining her faith. There she idled, waning and bleeding, for decades.

# University
Long after the abandonment of the town, the manor and surrounding grounds began to be squatted by a conglomeration between three neighbouring goblin tribes, the Caw Caws; Knitters; and Red Rocks, who dwelled in caves shared by rust monsters and appeased them by pilfering scrap metal. They converted the manor into a 'University', specializing in educating bandits and low folk in matters related to their craft.

The univesity is non-hostile to outsiders, hoping to enroll them as prospective students. They offer a variety of suitably Goblin courses:
- How to tell which birds you can eat from the sounds they make
- How to knit clothes
- How to make weapons out of metal
- Breaking cave creatures
- Butchering creatures that talk
- Stealing small things
- Stealing big things

The University has three main fraternities, formed of the three goblin tribes who founded and make up the bulk of the univerity. The Red Rocks have centred their fraternity around arena combat between rust monsters and other creatures. In preperation of a championship, they have stripped much of the metal out of the town and the surrounding area, including the signpost at the crossroads.

# Crossroads
The crossroads are the final resting place of [[Theth]], who is rotting in a cage suspended over the road in an act of humiliation and undeath.
