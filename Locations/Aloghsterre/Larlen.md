#location 
Larlen is a ruin, a broken town along the toad between [[Oakenhead]] and [[Aloghsterre]]. It flourished once, under a vampiric rule built around the worship of [[Theth]], an old religous practice centred around the sancity of blood: that which babes are born of. Larlen was not alone in this worship, and the worship was old, but Larlen was a flourishing town, not a druidic circle.

Elsewhere, emphasis began to be placed on Ichor, the blood of the gods, following the rise of vampiric warlock cults in the frozen north, who sought to bleed gods to empower themselves. The gods took a swift and harsh approach to blood-worship. Vampires were hunted, cults were snuffed and cities were burnt to bedrock by enraged zealots.

Larlen was razed to ruins, The Mother, Thoth, set to hang, caged, at a crossroads, her humiliating epitath barely sustaining her faith. There she idled, waning and bleeding, for decades.

Eventually, a conglomeration between three neighbouring goblin tribes, the Cawcaws; Knitters; and Redrocks, who dwelled in caves shared by rust monsters, and appeased them by pilfering scrap metal.
