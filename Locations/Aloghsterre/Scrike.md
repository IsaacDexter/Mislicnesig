#location
* Near-dead town ravaged by lycanthropy, at the behest of [[Ynys]] following the towns acceptance of [[Pauscht Caravan]]'s "medicine" unbeknownst to both the town and the faith to be little more than snake-oil.
- The town accepted the caravan’s blood-based tinctures in a desperate attempt to cure the bouts of an unknown wasting disease that was slowly bringing the town into ruin.
- As a result [[Ynys]] cursed the vials, leading to the towns emaciated citizens to develop lycanthropy, transforming into haggard [[Scrikian Lycanthropes]].
- Now the town slowly crumbles, dead in the day and echoing with maddening howls during the night.
## Layout
- The town is bordered by *Quarry cliff* to the north and *Cran hill* to the east. The cliffs were bored into during the quarrying to construct the town's southern wall. The cluster of houses around this north-eastern section are homes for the quarrymen.
- To the west, *Greel stream* flows down from the *Quarry cliffs*, at a waterfall and crossing. The road from this crossing leads to the diminutive *Cliffside gate*, which is seldom used.
- Immediately past this gate lies *Scrike hall*, which handled much of the cities affairs.
- Past the hall lies *The Halved Fiddler*, the inn of Scrike, and residential areas.
- Here, in the centre of town, lies the *Temple of Ynys*, ornamental and bearing its stark pillars, to which some of the feral ne'er-do-wells lie chained even today, alongside vast tablets displaying *Ynys' Precepts*.
- From the temple, the south-western road takes you to the *Southern gatehouse*, and the south-eastern road takes you to the *Cran Gatehouse*.
- Heading north takes you to the base of *Quarry cliffs*, *Quarrymen’s homes*, and the *Quarry depot*.
At the quarry can be found *Tin Tunnel*, *[[#Grove and Hadh Tunnel]]*, and the collapsed *East Tunnel*.
# Grove and Hadh Tunnel
* Grone & Hadh are a pair of half-orc sisters who leased land rights to the base of Quarry Cliff in [[Scrike]] from [[Eustace II]], believing it to be a steal as the insular nature of the town was concealed from them.
* Once they arrived in town, they soon realised their mistake but had to venture forth anyway, effectively having to set up depots prior to acquiring a workforce, as the town went out of their way to hamper their progress, often leading to written warnings from his lordship.
* After the potential spot for the quarry lay dormant for months, a wet summer in the region led to poor harvest and many in the township were forced to undertake work for the sisters in exchange for wages.
* **Secret**: In reality, it was [[Ynys]] who caused the wet summer as punishment for not outright killing the two outsiders. There is a certain lack of understanding of consequence amongst the divine judgement of that faith.
* Now the quarry was started and the sisters began to recoup their losses, overseeing the project personally.
* When the Lycanthropy plague began to hit the town, some of quarry groups ended up holed up in the tunnel, surviving miserably on hardbread from the depot.
* Fearing blame from the townsfolk, Grone & Hadh use their extensive knowledge of the tunnels as leverage amongst the townsfolk, but food is running scarce and patience is wearing thin, and the two sisters fear it shall be them who are sent on the first scavenging run…
