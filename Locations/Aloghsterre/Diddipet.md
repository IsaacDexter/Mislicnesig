Diddipet is a small village with strong links to [[Oakenhead]]. It is considerable smaller, and less involved in [[Oakenhead#Consorts' Day|Consorts' Day]].
# The Three Combs
A homely in run by [[1. Oakenhead#Fast|Fast]], named not for his speed or wit, but his endurance in bed. It is a small, welcoming, modest place, with comfortable rooms and good drink. It acts as the inn for both [[Oakenhead]] and Diddipet, and so is a little larger than would be standard for a village as small as Diddipet.
