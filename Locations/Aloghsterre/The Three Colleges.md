* The three oldest and most prestigious magical colleges were founded by [[The Starlit Prince]] during his rule.
* They are some of the most well respected colleges in the known lands, and are seen as the birthplace of magic for much of the region.
* With improvements in overseas relations, many folk have come from other lands to attempt to study there, sometimes with invitation.
* Not everyone has been accepted into the colleges however, and were forced to pursue their education in lesser colleges, return home, or even be displaced due to overpopulation within [[Aloghsterre]].

* The newest and most open and accessible of [[The Three Colleges]] founded by [[The Starlit Prince]], the founding of which was the last major action he performed before [[The Blinking]].
* In its prime, the college provided a comprehensive magical education focusing less on theory and far more on the utility of magic than the other colleges.
* The college was founded on the principle of providing foundational magic knowledge for the betterment of the kingdom for anyone to study, within only a couple of years.
* This brought much commerce and students to [[Aloghsterre]], leading partially to its gross overpopulation.
* Today, however, the university is stretched thin. Overabundance of students and lack of resources due to the city’s situation lead to the college refusing external applications, only allowing students from the local region. .
* This action was taken under the stewardship of [[Eustace II]] in 1104 Y.S..
* While this did restore the quality of teaching at the college, it lead to great discord amongst the.
* citizens of the city, and is primarily responsible for the threat of revolt in the region.
# Royal University of Magic
* The second of [[The Three Colleges]] college founded under [[The Starlit Prince]]’s rule, this was organised with the intention of training hands to assist him in the monumental undertaking of connecting The Mortal Realm with [[Faerie]] within the kingdoms
## Star Chart
* [[The Starlit Prince]] had the lands and the heavens charted during the course of his rule, leading to the most complete and most recent map of [[Mislicnesig]] ever created.
* Invaluable to [[Marauders]] and Sailors when performing celestial navigation.
* Invaluable to merchants when planning trade routes, even today.
* The maps are, however, outdated, and most copies will have modern kingdoms marked on top.
* Still produced today by [[#Royal University of Magic]]’s cartography department, unchanged thanks to the university’s unshifting ways.
# Weolcantam
* Weh-ohl-can-tam
* The first of [[The Three Colleges]] set up by [[The Starlit Prince]] during the early years of his rule, this is the far more aloof of [[The Three Colleges]] following no strict curriculum, and with little in its library.
* [[The Starlit Prince]] set up this college before he could write, under the belief magic should be taught intimately from master to apprentice.
* Definitely the smallest of the colleges, featuring only a handful of classrooms and less than a dozen “masters”, each of which taking on only a couple apprentices - there are easily only 50 students within the college at any one time.
* In spite of its small size, only the finest in the land are employed as professors, and are held in very very high esteem - a magical education here is done with such intensity that it can train a powerful magic user in as little as two years.
* Many of the professors and selected students are already sorcerers, containing an innate gift to be honed in the education, though some exceptionally gifted people without natural magical capability have been taken on.
* Incredibly few students here have failed their magical education, though some have taken up to 7 years on their courses.
* The college simply will not accept failure, the course is said to be able to “turn anyone into a magician, given time”.
* A magical education here is without expense - the teachers and graduates have enough magical capability to not need money.
* The Headmaster of Weolcantam is often also one of the [[The Starlit Prince#Starlit Servants]], one of the few people knowledgeable of [[The Starlit Prince]]’s current whereabouts.
* The college is actually used to vet potential [[The Starlit Prince#Starlit Servants]], with truly exemplary graduates conferred to in secret from the rest of the staff and pupils to be offered an invitation.
