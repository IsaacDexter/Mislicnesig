* The three oldest and most prestigious magical colleges were founded by [[The Starlit Prince]] during his rule.
* They are some of the most well respected colleges in the known lands, and are seen as the birthplace of magic for much of the region.
* With improvements in overseas relations, many folk have come from other lands to attempt to study there, sometimes with invitation.
* Not everyone has been accepted into the colleges however, and were forced to pursue their education in lesser colleges, return home, or even be displaced due to overpopulation within [[Aloghsterre]].

* The newest and most open and accessible of [[The Three Colleges]] founded by [[The Starlit Prince]], the founding of which was the last major action he performed before [[The Blinking]].
* In its prime, the college provided a comprehensive magical education focusing less on theory and far more on the utility of magic than the other colleges.
* The college was founded on the principle of providing foundational magic knowledge for the betterment of the kingdom for anyone to study, within only a couple of years.
* This brought much commerce and students to [[Aloghsterre]], leading partially to its gross overpopulation.
* Today, however, the university is stretched thin. Overabundance of students and lack of resources due to the city’s situation lead to the college refusing external applications, only allowing students from the local region. .
* This action was taken under the stewardship of [[Eustace II]] in 1104 Y.S..
* While this did restore the quality of teaching at the college, it lead to great discord amongst the.
* citizens of the city, and is primarily responsible for the threat of revolt in the region.
# Royal University of Magic
As the second of the prince's colleges, RUM was founded with the intention of training folk to assist in navigation, diplomacy and commerce with the kingdoms of the island, not least of all the kingdom of [[Faerie]]. As such, its curriculum is surprisingly unfocused on magic, and it is markedly the most elite of the three colleges.
Since the prince's disappearance, the focus on fairy relations has almost completely subsided, though one may certainly find fairy anthropologists in the dusty towers and far-fetched wings of the grandiose building.

Nowadays, studies in trade and commerce have dwarfed the other areas of study at the university, and created a sense of elitism amongst the higher echelons of mercantile society: without a scholarship from RUM, one will find it near impossible to broker relations with the island's trade giants. Attendees are referred to as '[[#Rummies]]', and enjoy an unmatched level of prestige in trading circles.
However, students do still attend and apply to the cartography, navigation, linguistics, relations, heraldry and anthropology courses. These students are vastly outnumbered by Rummies, and their teaching resources are slim. As such, they form a great bond with their teaching staff, and know each other as the '[[#Last Academics]]'.

RUM is dwarfed by the sprawling [[#Aeghwelc]], but is certainly larger than the intimate [[#Weolcantam]]. It features some of the most extravagance of the three, thanks to the excessive spending by the staff and patrons of the rummies. Tall, white towers, roomy corridors and elaborate masonry and tiling give an air of exclusivity and elegance. 
Run down areas of the school's dwindling north wing house the few academics present in the college. These areas are more dusty, less financed and are beginning to show signs of neglect. They aren't run down, as the college needs to maintain it showy exterior, but they clearly don't receive as much spending as those in the school of commerce.
## Rummies
Snide, pompous, and self-absorbed, Rummies come to RUM not out of a want for learning, but more in pursuit of a mandatory qualification. Work is not strict, and all but the dimmest of students can coast by, though those who truly do wish to succeed have the opportunity to do so - some Last Academics do, in fact, study the commerce courses.
Rummies are almost universally hated by the other colleges due to their cavalier attitude, and bully Last Academics relentlessly.
## Last Academics
Unlike the aloof rummies, Last Academics are devoted to their niche study, and form intimate bonds with the few members of teaching staff still on payroll. 
The lack of focus of magic besides divination and enchantment in the curriculum (especially in the trade and commerce courses) renders them a subject of ridicule from students of Aeghwelc, and the rivalry between themselves and the rummies is deep and bitter. They do, however, have the respect of Weolcantam students, thanks to their dedication to their pursuits. There is much collaboration between the students and staff of these two groups.
In general, they don't have ample opportunity to carouse, and are often shy towards strangers. However, they adore the chance to discuss their subjects of choice, and a wealth of knowledge on whatever obscure area they are being asked about.
# Weolcantam
* Weh-ohl-can-tam
* The first of [[The Three Colleges]] set up by [[The Starlit Prince]] during the early years of his rule, this is the far more aloof of [[The Three Colleges]] following no strict curriculum, and with little in its library.
* [[The Starlit Prince]] set up this college before he could write, under the belief magic should be taught intimately from master to apprentice.
* Definitely the smallest of the colleges, featuring only a handful of classrooms and less than a dozen “masters”, each of which taking on only a couple apprentices - there are easily only 50 students within the college at any one time.
* In spite of its small size, only the finest in the land are employed as professors, and are held in very very high esteem - a magical education here is done with such intensity that it can train a powerful magic user in as little as two years.
* Many of the professors and selected students are already sorcerers, containing an innate gift to be honed in the education, though some exceptionally gifted people without natural magical capability have been taken on.
* Incredibly few students here have failed their magical education, though some have taken up to 7 years on their courses.
* The college simply will not accept failure, the course is said to be able to “turn anyone into a magician, given time”.
* A magical education here is without expense - the teachers and graduates have enough magical capability to not need money.
* The Headmaster of Weolcantam is often also one of the [[The Starlit Prince#Starlit Servants]], one of the few people knowledgeable of [[The Starlit Prince]]’s current whereabouts.
* The college is actually used to vet potential [[The Starlit Prince#Starlit Servants]], with truly exemplary graduates conferred to in secret from the rest of the staff and pupils to be offered an invitation.
