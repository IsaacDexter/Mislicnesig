#location 
- Duchy under stewardship of [[#Duke Tumm]], consisting of the town of Molan and the surrounding wilds
# Duke Tumm
- Gaske Tumn, chaotic evil [[Drow]] Duke of Molan
- In spite of his petty position as Duke of a small town, who has become drunk on power and fancies himself an aristocrat and even - in reality he is but petty nobility in holding of a small town as part of a larger scheme by the barons
- A plump fellow of ashen skin and bulging eyes, he holds the slender frame common to his people but not in the face, possessing pudgy features as if his face were moulded of putty
- He hijacked the exhibits of The Gaske Tumn Museum of Gallantry and Heroism after giving it its new name (as opposed to its original title of Museum of Molan) and had much of the old treasures placed in archival storage
- He stole the [[infernalpaca]] with the hopes of having it taxidermied by [[#Jollipet and Co., Weavers]], and have it pose as his steed in the central exhibit of the museum
- He also had Curator Clyle make a secret order of the [[infernalpaca]] fur from Zaltaen Gallori at the [[#Molan Menagerie]], to be woven into a set of britches by Kiskey, Botch and Vallaway Weaving Inc for the wax model to wear, as even taxidermied the fur is still scalding to the touch - but correctly woven, the fur is remarkably heatproof
- Wern Vallaway seeks help from his competitors at Trellew and Jollipet, Weavers, as he cannot truly weave, and revealing this to the mayor would back out his funding
# Molan Menagerie
- Petting Zoo and Menagerie in the town of Molan reluctantly funded by Duke Tumm, ran by Jestle Rue, and headed by 3 Heads of Staff: The lookout of livestock, Bilsko Ghee; The carer of critters; and Zaltaen Gallori, tuletary of the tropical. The other staff are divided amongst the other heads of department on a day to day basis
## Jestle Rue
## Glitz Turmokonen
## Zaltaen Gallori
## Bilsko Ghee
- Headed by Bilsko Ghee, the livestock department at [[#Molan Menagerie]] is in charge of handling all of the farm animals that have come to the menagerie - some of these are ‘working’ animals, whose milk, eggs or fur can be purchased at the Farm Shop & Eatery
## Fria's Fryer
### Fria Coleen
- Head Chef and front of house at the Farm Shop & Eatery within Molan Menagerie
- Friendly and welcoming Human trying her hand at cookery in her old age
- Lawful Good
- Has previously worked as an adventurer herself, alongside a sailor even earlier in life, Fria is a capable combatant and always willing to lend a hand
- What she lacks in knowledge of animals she makes up for in gossip, she is always overhearing the conversations of her patrons
- **Secret (DC 12)**: 
	- Fria had to serve a pair of scoundrels on Tuesday who she remembers wanting to throw out of her cafe, but they were ordering so much cake she couldn’t bear to let the potential profits loose
	- She overheard them calling 
# The Gaske Tumn Museum of Gallantry and Heroism
- Was once the Molan Museum of Weaving, which showcased the craftsmanship of the town of Molan, as well as some taxidermy work of animals and plantlife crucial to the trade
- Was recently converted by [[#Duke Tumm]] to one big ego boost: the museum talks only briefly of actual local heroes such as [[#Fria Coleen]], and instead focuses on the lambasting previous Dukes and bigging up Tumn’s paltry achievements
- Features a showcase of a pair of fireproof britches produced at , a mannequin of a far slimmer and attractive Duke, and a saddle for his ‘steed none others could tame’, which is not to be found
- Secret: this steed is in fact the [[Infernalpaca]], which the Duke planned to taxidermy after having it burgled from [[#Molan Menagerie]]
- In the basement are haunted Living Taxidermies from the old days of the museum.
- Within the basements of the The Gaske Tumn Museum of Gallantry and Heroism, the vengeful spirit of [[Gelwaré#Saint Vaul]] revives several varieties of these taxidermies that stumble jerkily out of their glass cases and towards those who enter.
## Curator Clyle
- Ottie Clyle, chaotic neutral (and neurotic) Head Curator at The Gaske Tumn Museum of Gallantry and Heroism, who does not mind the overhauling of the displays simply because it supports her hoarding personality
- Treats the museum simply as an outlet for her excessive collecting.
# Jollipet and Co., Weavers
- Underdog of the two rival weaving companies remaining in the town of Molan
## Janet Jollipet
## Brian Jollipet
- Elderly human gentleman with stained hands and gnarled skin up to his forearms thanks to his work in taxidermy prior to his retirement into weaving
- His hair is a thinning mop of grey, his eyes are sad like a basset hound's, but his smile is genuine - he seems happy, though somewhat remorseful
- For a much of his life before partnering with his wife [[#Janet Jollipet]], Brian was a taxidermist and performed invaluable work with the [[#The Gaske Tumn Museum of Gallantry and Heroism]] to preserve much history in the region
- This work and his wife’s profession inspired him to settle down and take up the life of a weaver
- He is still more than capable at his craft however, and was sought by [[#Duke Tumm]] to stuff the Hell-paca for his exhibit at the museum
- Since meeting his wife, however, his faith in [[Larewes]] has dwindled, as he adopts more of his wife’s [[Gelwaré]] way of thought.
# Kiskey, Botch and Vallaway Weaving Inc.
- Commercial giant responsible for bankrupting many of the weaving companies present in Molan
- Their Unmanned Magical Mills perform faster and more cheaply and to a higher degree of quality than regular tradespeople
- **Secret (DC 15 Arcana):**
	- In reality these magical mills scarcely work - they crudely weave fabric for [[#Wern Vallaway]] to cast illusionary magic upon, giving the illusion of delicate craftsmanship
## Cloy Kiskey
## Ekkesque Botch
## Wern Vallaway
- Lawful evil half-elf warlock behind the Unmanned Magical Mills at Kiskey, Botch and Vallaway Weaving Inc
- Her patron is [[Helthe#Ack]], Administrator of Avarice, who drives her insatiable greed to govern her actions
- She, along with [[#Cloy Kiskey]] and [[#Ekkesque Botch]], are leading a con on the good people of Molan by selling illusory silk of seemingly the finest quality to the people, uppercutting legitimate tradespeople
