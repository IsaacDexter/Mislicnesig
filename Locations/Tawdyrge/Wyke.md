- Verdant forest region comprised primarily of small connected towns and hamlets
# Baroness Thraske
- Tamiera Thraske, Baroness of Wyke
- Influential and corrupt baron pushing alongside much dissenters amongst [[Tawdyrge#Lord Asquer]]’s court for the rape of [[Tawdyrge]] through industry
- Highly unpopular with worshipers of both [[Gelwaré]] and [[Larewes]], for the despoilment of their lands and the disregard of tradespeople respectively 
- In the process of becoming ludicrously wealthy through ownership or partial ownership of growing industrial plants
- Played an exigent role in the redundancy of much of the tradesfolk in Wyke through foreclosure, raising of rent and buying out of raw materials through highball offers
# Wyke River
# Paignton The Peerless
- Great hero from Wyke who fought against a forgotten threat
- Now lies at the bottom of [[Molan#The Gaske Tumn Museum of Gallantry and Heroism]]’s archive, slowly being forgotten so [[Molan#Duke Tumm]] can bolster his ego once more, painting himself as a hero as opposed to a cowardly figure consumed with greed
