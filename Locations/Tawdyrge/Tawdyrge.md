- Large and verdant Fiefdom to the south of [[Mislicnesig]], of which [[Molan]] is a burgage
- Ruled over by [[#Lord Asquer]], the land is hardly opposed but there is much contention
- Land is steadily giving rise to theological tensions between ancestrally indigenous groups (primarily elven and gnomish) who predominantly worship [[Gelwaré]], and subscribers to the more modern [[Larewes]] Pantheon
- In reality, this is a facet of greater political strife being fostered by gods of even footing, to bolster their faith against overseas influences
# Lord Asquer
- Rettegold of Asquer, born to the venerable elven house of Asquer
- Neutral Good lord of [[Tawdyrge]] who simply inherited a bad situation
- Theological tensions between old faith ‘cults’ and modern religions have had to have been left unchecked due to adopting his forefathers’ policies of political indifference - tensions are better than persecution and all out war
- The fall of independent business to lord-owned/sponsored giants has led to less tithes collected by his court, who do not fairly tithe their own businesses as they already pocket the profits
- Simply put, Asquer doesn't have the power to rectify his situation, none of his court would trust him with that power as it would undo their powerful positions, and none of the commoners would trust him with true allegiance out of a distrust of the regency thanks to his out of control court
