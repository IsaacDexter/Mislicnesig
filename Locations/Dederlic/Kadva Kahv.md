#figure #faction
Human warlord who claims to be half-orc. Roughly a decade ago, he began leading a series of raids of the displaced communities to the west of [[Dederlic]] and the north of [[Kitterland]], and was at war with the [[Regal Consortium of Pulit-Aspell]]. Their force consists of mercenaries, brigands and captured forces from the various competing manors of Dederlic.
His attacks have been less about conquest and more about pillaging. He is securing a future for himself and his family over his men, and has only remained in power thanks to his intimidation, tactics and barbarity. Upon his death, without an heir to succeed him, all he has wrought will fall to nought. This vexes him, and he tries desperately for an heir.
The two factions are currently truced, as foreign forces from [[Latus]] are trying to establish themselves and their worship of [[Robus]] on the east coast. Both sides are small, as [[Mislicnesig]] is remote, and Latus has little incentive to conquer it. Nevertheless, each side is fighting fiercely.
