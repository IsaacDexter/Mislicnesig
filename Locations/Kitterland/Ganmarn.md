#location
An Inhospitable sandstone butte range to the west of [[Kitterland]], that makes passage from [[Losian]] far more difficult.
# Treppeway
The easiest safe route from [[Losian]] across Ganmarn. Often acosted by bandits and the treacherous wildlife of Kitterland. The recommended safer route is going along the range to the north, then west across [[Dederlic]].
