*A sparse, wet, sandy region to the west dominated by aquatic insects and molluscs. The folk here live in stilted towns and ride on crabs, snails and flying insects. The land is rich but inhospitable, and resource-panning, insect hunting (for rare dyes and chitin), fishing, and mushroom gathering are primary occupations. The land is ruled by the [[Regal Consortium of Pulit-Aspell]], a sort of merchant-lord alliance, whose greed gives the occupants much strife. There is a strong naval tradition and force, and fish is a sought after and expensive source of protein.*

# Climate
Kitterland is a sandy and wet coastal region of [[Mislicnesig]] characterised by its estuaries and scrubland. It's soil is primarily silty and sandy, and can feel quite mushy underfoot. Folk describe it as a cross between a desert and a marshland. 

The land is flat and inhospitable, but underfoot conditions make traditional long distance travel difficult: heavy but small-footed creatures such as horses and people find themselves sinking into the silt with each step, which makes travel laborious. Sinking sand is not unheard of in the region. 

Estuaries and tributaries litter the landscape, and are responsible for the dampness that is constantly underfoot. Sea-life, like land-life, is dominated by semi-aquatic insects and molluscs, and the two are less divided than in other regions.

It is for this reason that molluscs, semi-aquatic creatures such as crabs are made use of, often wrangled from the coast and brought to land. Their presence on the surface was not facilitated by intelligent races, and biodiversity on the region was already dominated by molluscs, who could easily glide along the flat surfaces chewing on shrubland.

Birds, both giant and regular, are a creature common to the region. They prey on and are preyed on by the giant flying insects that also make the region home. Giant insects outnumber birds in this region. 

The dampness and decomposition of the region make mushrooms and mega fungi a common sight, roughly as common as fauna and plant matter.

Some of the flora around here is significant, rare or prized, and there is much in the way of hallucinogenic, potion ingredients and more lying around.
# Population
Settlement in this region is varied and difficult. The climate is bountiful but inhospitable, and towns need careful guarding and vigilance against the local wildlife. Starvation is rare, but death to local fauna is far from uncommon.

Settlements are usually sparse and stilted, sort of old western vibe. Trees and wood aren't super common, but dried fungus, driftwood, chitin and whole chunks of insect and crab husks make up houses. 

Folk are hardy varied and scarred, there are no real natives to this region, its occupation on a larger scale is more recent. They rarely take too kindly to outsiders, and work a range of hands on jobs. The lands, though dangerous, are bountiful, and there is much work in harvesting fungus (for food and export), wrangling and hunting bugs (for chitin, ingredients, and riding) panning for rare minerals such as gold, and fishing.

There is a strong naval tradition - with land being so difficult to traverse, and roads being out of the question, flying bugs, aquatic creatures, boats of lightweight and hardy chitin, and mollusc and crab mounts make up the bulk of vehicles in this region. Fish are a rare and prized resource, they are reserved for the wealthy and feature prominently and banquets, as most food in region are just gross mushrooms and bugs.
# Politics
The land is ruled by the [[Regal Consortium of Pulit-Aspell]], a sort of pseudo-royal merchant navy that made a concerted effort to colonise this wild and previously scarcely inhabited region.

The ruling class are thoroughly disliked by the common man, they see their presence in this region as part of a business venture (which it is). Common folk are expendable to the wealthy. 

A lack of any real centralized government leads foreign affairs to be a squabble. There is an official, centralized naval force, but it is badly monitored and features too many conflicts of interest to be particularly effective. They typically only focus on ferrying merchant vessels, as export is very important in this region.

Individual members of the ruling class hold direct ownership of their towns, its a sort of anarcho-capitalist thing, but they're all in a little enclave and tend to get along for the most part, as they're technically allied. Individual admirals within the naval fleet tend to be in bed with individual political forces.
# Religion
Being a newly occupied region, there is little in the way of a centralized religion. [[Regal Consortium of Pulit-Aspell]]'s members typically follow [[Charatan]] (which perhaps accounts for their ineffable greed). They do not, however, impose such beliefs on their constituents: Charatanites do not benefit from more followers, only more underlings.

Individual communities usually immigrated from regions throughout [[Mislicnesig]], and typically get along alright. In Kitterland, there's more things to be worried about than religion: the lack of numbers here leads to a lack of divine intervention - why preach to the meek and needy when there are so few of them?
# History
Kitterland remained mostly uninhabited until recent centuries, when advancements in sea travel and international trade, brought about during the [[Age of Persecution]], prompted the formation of the [[Regal Consortium of Pulit-Aspell]], who intentionally made moves to bring folk into the region. 

Ancient history in the region is not non-existent, but little artefacts of it exist. There is no real material to build longstanding structures, so little exist. [[The Routes Between]] were not reopened in this region during the [[Reign of Starlight]], and [[Puttock, Holly King]]'s forces during [[Hollytide]] ceased intervention in the region after losing too much the inhospitable lands

Some hardy communities predate the consortiums intervention. It wasn't completely devoid of civilization, just a very wild area of the world.
