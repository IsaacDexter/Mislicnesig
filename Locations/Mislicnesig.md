![[Map.png]]
* Main setting for the campaign.
* Officially recognises itself as a single country with a sole set of laws, warded over by a [[Aloghsterre#Stewards]], in this case [[Eustace II]], but in reality the country has been in disarray for its existence and is in fact made up of several countries, which for the most part remain peaceful with one another.
* Officially ruled by it's steward, Eustace II, as acting ruler-in-waiting for [[The Starlit Prince]]’s return, but his rule isn’t recognised anywhere except internally within [[Aloghsterre]].
* Somewhat consistent ecosystem reflective of England, with magic being the main cause for different biomes - it is colder further north, and more barren and snowy, while certain areas to the northeast are more coastal and almost Mediterranean.
* No official religion, despite [[The Starlit Prince]] taking massive precedence within the capital: while the lands within Mislicnesig do not mind Eustace’s figurehead rule, they would resent a single religion being forced upon a region with such wildly diverse theologies.
# Regions
Mislicnesig is divided into several regions, or kingdoms, each comprising of different climate.
- [[Aloghsterre]], a verdant, forested land containing many rivers. Ruled by [[Eustace II]].
- [[Folahethe]], a land of rolling downland and pasture. Rural and sparse, controlled by vying nobility.
- [[Tawdyrge]], consisting farmland and forest, with a great deal of coastal regions thanks to its twin estuaries. Incredibly split rulership, with much of the land 'controlled' by the puppet, [[Tawdyrge#Lord Asquer]].
- [[Kitterland]], which hosts and incredibly varied and inhospitable fauna and climate, featuring giant bugs and crabs. Made up of mesas, deserts and sandy lowlands. Communities are rough and ready. It is undergoing exploitation at the hands of the [[Regal Consortium of Pulit-Aspell]].
- [[Losian]], cut off from Kitterland by a range of mesas and buttes. Densely knotted trees and roots on chalky outcroppings. High dark cliffs, like Rock of Ages.
- [[Dederlic]], a warring region of tall tors and moors, a varied region.
- [[Banofdune]]
# Calendar
* There are several calendars of years used throughout [[Mislicnesig]], but they usually follow the same structure, simply following different years.
* Calendars of saints vary wildly from region to region - some saints are seen in common, others are completely different. Not every religion has sainthood at all, let alone enough saints to require a calendar.
## Stewards' Calendar
* Official calendar of [[Mislicnesig]], observed for official purposes within the courts of the castle, and almost nowhere else.
* Created by the Stewards
* Counted simply as years and months into the current stewardship, starting on the day the current steward took hold.
# Culture
## Public Opinion of Magic
* Magic, though not disbarred, can lead to ostracisation through the efforts of the gods.
* During the [[Reign of Starlight]], the gods shrank, many residing largely on temple faith, and some were forgotten altogether. Their grip on the world was loosened and for once, [[Aln the Mad]] slept.
* This was through no active effort of [[The Starlit Prince]], who, though in servitude of no faith, never sought to extinguish the flame of the divine.
* Instead, it was the promise and allure of learned magic that waned the god’s influence on [[Mislicnesig]] - what need had man of gods, when miracles could be wrought by their own hands?
* The construction of [[The Three Colleges]] furthered the pursuits of arcane magics among common folk, especially with [[The Three Colleges#Aeghwelc]] taking on students for free to intentionally spread magic.
* Following [[The Blinking]], however, the gods rose again to prominence, and they now knew of the real threat arcane magic posed to them.
	* The key exception to this was [[The Starlit Prince]], to whom the practice of arcane study was as much worship as anything else. It is thanks to this and the powerful arcane seals cast by [[The Starlit Prince]] that [[The Three Colleges]] remain open.
* Gods incited their followers to shun the arcane, instead promoting acting as a conduit for divine magic through Oaths and The Clergy.
* Druidic magic is exempt to this hatred however, as the gods do not fear it - druids reside in conclave and are secretive: until druids share their wealth of knowledge with the greater world, druidic magic will never be a threat to the gods and lords.
