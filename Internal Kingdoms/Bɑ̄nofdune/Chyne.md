* From Old English Chyne(Breakage, opening of a wound, spine).
* Small cluster of mountains, separate to [[Scyldhrig]], but formed of the same fissure.
* Sharp, ridgelike mountains made of mottled chalk and red chalk, they really do look like a bloodied spine striking out the downland.
* Underground folk (predominantly [[Dwarves]] and [[Drow]], who figured out the alchemical side of things) have engineered an alchemical way to extract iron from the oxidised red chalk, and use the remainder of the chalk as quicklime to expedite the steel-making process. 
	* This alchemical process uses other reagents and minerals found in the chalk, allowing them to centralise all production in a single mine, as coal deposits are also found, which speckle the mountains black.
* Mining and quarry operations boomed amongst the underground folk who inhabited the mountains.
# Blutgmar Collapse
* The blood mountain, Blutgmar (so named for its concentration of red chalk), was overmined, and thanks to the soft chalk, began to collapse, causing a mass exodus. This massively divided the Chynian populace:
	* By now, export of the steel (and the accompanying Dwarven works) had becoming a booming industry, and much of the peoples livelihood.
	* Many folk wished to restart production in a new mountain, but a lack of employment would lead to rushed set up, causing even more contention over fears of a repeat of the previous disaster
	* This fractured Chynian peoples, leading to two major factions, [[Gmarthryll]] and [[Ridgefound]].
		* [[Ridgefound]] wished to continue to mine the mountains, exporting its wealth in steel.
		* [[Gmarthryll]] became cultish and sought to protect the exploitation of the mountain, seeking less exploitative mining practices and disallowing export of steel where they could.
		* Tensions still ride high today.
