* Magic, though not disbarred, can lead to ostracisation through the efforts of the gods.
* During the [[Reign of Starlight]], the gods shrank, many residing largely on temple faith, and some were forgotten altogether. Their grip on the world was loosened and for once, [[Aln the Mad]] slept.
* This was through no active effort of [[The Prince Under Starlight]], who, though in servitude of no faith, never sought to extinguish the flame of the divine.
* Instead, it was the promise and allure of learned magic that waned the god’s influence on [[Mislicnesig]] - what need had man of gods, when miracles could be wrought by their own hands?
* The construction of [[The Three Colleges]] furthered the pursuits of arcane magics among common folk, especially with [[Æghwelc]] taking on students for free to intentionally spread magic.
* Following [[The Blinking]], however, the gods rose again to prominence, and they now knew of the real threat arcane magic posed to them.
	* The key exception to this was [[The Prince’s Cult]], to whom the practice of arcane study was as much worship as anything else. It is thanks to this and the powerful arcane seals cast by [[The Prince Under Starlight]] that [[The Three Colleges]] remain open.
* Gods incited their followers to shun the arcane, instead promoting acting as a conduit for divine magic through Oaths and The Clergy.
* Druidic magic is exempt to this hatred however, as the gods do not fear it - druids reside in conclave and are secretive: until druids share their wealth of knowledge with the greater world, druidic magic will never be a threat to the gods and lords.
