* Prehistoric and primordial Dragon responsible for the eastern lineage of dragonborn, Ghut lived in [[Bletch]], a vast mire to the northwest of [[Attermoor]].
* She was a putrid and mottled black, and sullied the once magical mire with mists and gasses.
* Early humanoid settlements (mostly elven and gnomish) nearby were abundant, and she chose to raise some clutches with a lesser green dragon who once lived to the north.
* She killed her mate in a fight to the death after her second brood hatched, looking for fertile land for her green hatchlings to be raised.
* She continued this pattern until practically all of the green dragon population in the region was descended from her own lineage.
* She raised several clutches of [[Green Dragonborn]], putting them to endless enslavement organising her treasure.
* Her dragonborn’s faith bore a deity, [[Ghut, Mirequeen]], who poisoned the mind of [[Aln the Mad]], hoping to incite him and Ghut to breed a more powerful race of worshipers, but instead leading him to invade Ghut’s lands.
* He came down and slew much of Ghut’s servants, before engaging her in combat - Ghut managed to take his sight but was ultimately overwhelmed by the Great Wyrm, leading to her death.
* This eventually led to the freedom of the [[Green Dragonborn]] she kept as thralls
