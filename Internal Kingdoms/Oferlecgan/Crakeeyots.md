* Crake-eights.
* Collection of sizable islands to the east of [[Oferlecgan]] whose access was blocked when the once temperate, coastal butte/cliff range of [[Eotenset]] grew inhospitable with the driving of [[Aln the Mad]].
* Barmy tropical and Mediterranean environment markedly different from the rest of [[Mislicnesig]], though once similar to [[Eotenset]].
* Still possible to reach on the long way round by boats, occasionally used by pirates as a stopping point or treasure hoard, though rarely - the nearby seas are subarctic and often frozen, and sailors swap stories of a vast dragon attacking boats.
* Their inaccessibility leads them to be mostly unoccupied, despite numerous attempts. The lands are rich and fertile, but remote. Settlements are returned to, only to be found ravaged and empty from what is assumed to be tropical storms, but is in fact [[Aln the Mad]].
* Ancient temples from long before [[Aln the Mad]]â€™s arrival lie undisturbed on the island, preserved by magic and a lack of contact.
* These temples act as Sitting Houses, granting [[Artefact Faith]], and holding traps and loot in the form of offerings to these [[Small Gods]].
* These gods are propped up by [[Marauders]] who bestow gifts to these gods under the mercy of [[Marin]]
