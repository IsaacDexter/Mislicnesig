* Possibly the longest lived dragon in the realms, he had long been a Great Wyrm by the time he killed [[Ghut]], but never ascended into Greatwyrm - he was too mad to see the otherworldly echoes he’d’ve needed to consume.
* Lives in [[Eotenset]].
* Gigantic silver dragon, lived off of bounty from the mountainside seas.
* Never reached the status of a deity as he never kept thralls or raised a single clutch - Aln was mad to begin with, and only got madder.
* [[Ghut, Mirequeen]], borne of a terrible and fear-ridden adulation from her real life counterpart’s thralls, grew greedy, and sought to invade the dreams of a nearby powerful dragon (Aln), hoping to inspire the two to raise a clutch of followers who were even stronger than the [[Green Dragonborn]].
* Finding a dragon of such power with so little mental defences seemed a blessing, but Aln had long been mad, and grew filled with rage and spite at the pleasant dreams of family and lust that invaded his mind.
* After just a few years of this, he stirred from his isolated frozen home and flew to the marshes, engaging in a deadly battle with [[Ghut]] that cost him his eyes and [[Ghut]] her life, as well as the lives of the vast majority of her servants.
* All of her dragonborn thralls, still in her caverns sorting her near immeasurable wealth, survived, as they were never called to battle.
* He flew back, deep into the mountains, relying on an internal compass now his sight had been lost, and went to spend time in solitude once more, now without his eyes.
* While [[Ghut]] was dead, [[Ghut, Mirequeen]] lived on in the hearts of those [[Green Dragonborn]] who had once been her thralls.
* Other gods, inspired by the action to invade the mind of this once hidden force in the world, all vied to plant dreams and thoughts in the mind of Aln, hoping to poison him for use in their own designs.
* This cacophony of divine whispers proved too loud however, and Aln’s mind only grew more cluttered and mad.
* Now he stumbles from cliff to coast in his craggy coastal home, speaking to himself in old tongues and consuming anything he senses.
* Various gods continue to this day to vie for power in Aln’s head hoping one day to have obtained enough strength to speak clearly over the cacophony of other gods and have the Great Wyrm do their bidding, forever changing the scape of the world
