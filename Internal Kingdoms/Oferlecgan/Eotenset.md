* [ˈe͜o.tenset](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%CB%88e%CD%9Co.tenset&voice=Amy), Aer-tun-set
* Vast and impressive coastal butte/cliff range to the north-east of [[Mislicnesig]], in [[Oferlecgan]], home to little other than [[Aln the Mad]]
* Buttes and plateaus of slate and tundra climate
* Little known humanoid inhabitants - those nearby know of a great danger in those mountains, even aside from the cold
* Blisteringly cold even at low altitudes due to [[Aln the Mad]]’s influence on the local environment; the nearby oceans are unnaturally cold also
* Was once a barmy mediterranean region
* Creatures here are arctic and hardy, and more concentrated near the coasts where food is slightly more abundant
* All but block access to [[Crakeeyots]] from the mainland, making them an elusive and little habited location
