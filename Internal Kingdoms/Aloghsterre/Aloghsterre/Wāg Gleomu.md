* Warg Gleh-muh.
* Royal palace of [[Aloghsterre]], constructed by [[The Prince Under Starlight]].
* Rule was overseen by [[The Prince Under Starlight]] from his glass throne.
* It featured the infamously shattered glass throne, many of the pieces of which still lie guarded in the throne room, which happened during [[The Blinking]].
* [[Stewards]] oversea affairs from a wooden seat to the left of the shattered throne.
* This palace’s throne room also is without a roof - the sky above is always without a cloud, and the stars shine extraordinarily brightly, hence The Prince’s name.
* This was achieved through ancient weather magic the prince worked to revive, naming [[Weolcantam]] after this, his favourite spell; the prince always loved the stars.
* The walls of the throne room were embedded with [[Signetstone]] stars, a gift received from his prosperous alliances with members of [[Faerie]]; these wall stars would twinkle as if they were the stars above.
* These stars were ripped out to forge signet rings and pose as nobles during [[The Blinking]]; which gave the dark period its name.
