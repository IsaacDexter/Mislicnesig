* The three oldest and most prestigious magical colleges were founded by [[The Prince Under Starlight]] during his rule.
* They are some of the most well respected colleges in the known lands, and are seen as the birthplace of magic for much of the region.
* With improvements in overseas relations, many folk have come from other lands to attempt to study there, sometimes with invitation.
* Not everyone has been accepted into the colleges however, and were forced to pursue their education in lesser colleges, return home, or even be displaced due to overpopulation within [[Aloghsterre]].
