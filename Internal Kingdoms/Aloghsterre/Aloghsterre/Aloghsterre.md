- When the lands were united by [[The Prince Under Starlight]], a great capital was constructed, centred around [[Wāg Gleomu]].
- The rulers of this kingdom technically rule the entire kingdom - seeing the other kingdoms within the isle as sub-kingdoms if on good terms, or illegitimate if on bad terms.
- The rulers of this kingdom are [[Stewards]]: descendants of The Prince’s closest allies, and make it clear they rule in [[The Prince Under Starlight]]’s stead, sitting beside the shattered throne and awaiting his return.
- There is a great deal of worship of [[The Prince’s Cult]] in this kingdom, though there is no officially stated religion.
- The capital is incredibly well fortified, both architecturally and magically, leftovers from [[The Prince Under Starlight]]’s rule.
- In spite of the small amount of lands governed and lack of military might, this kingdom is incredibly secure and stands almost no chance of invasion, even from overseas
- The current steward is [[Eustace II]], who is fair and just, and has made several alliances with the sub-kingdoms, encouraging overseas relations, and without letting their lives be governed through religious matters.
- The capital retains some alliances with certain loyal courts within [[Faerie]], but due to a limited amount of land within the kingdom; little wild land; and [[The Routes Between]] being inaccessible; the two aren't able to provide much assistance, even in times of need, in spite of friendly relations.
- Such land, which the king once managed well to retain wilderness and [[The Routes Between]], have been forced to convert to farmland to support a growing population within a limited space.
- The buildings within the capital are stacked precariously high, making the most of the limited land available. There is little economic wealth, but great security and friendly people, and it is generally deemed to be a pleasant place to live.
- It also contains some of the only still functioning magical academies set up by the king, [[The Three Colleges]].
