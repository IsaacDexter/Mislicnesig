* Tiefling Wizard in his late sixties, retired in the sleepy village of  [[Pont-Deri]] but once a professor at [[Æghwelc]] and an inventor of magical items.
* Responsible for the production of Fulbairn’s Folding Ford and Fulbairn’s Collapsible Cascade, now pursuing experiments with more ‘eccentric’ magical items in his old age.
* In reality, he’s nought but an old pervert and has spent the remaining years of his existence creating a variety of increasingly novel enchanted sex toys which he plans to leave as a portion of his inheritance.
* He has become somewhat of a Casanova in the village, having relations with many a widow and widower, as well as some with surviving spouses, much to some of the village’s disdain.
