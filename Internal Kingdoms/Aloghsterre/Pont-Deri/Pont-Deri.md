#aloghsterre 
* Pont (Welsh prefix meaning bridge) + Deri (Welsh for oak).
* Tiny Village located in [[Aloghsterre]], near [[Oakenhead]].
* Old, sleepy village with no youths save for those visiting their elders, a popular retirement destination for those with family in [[Aloghsterre]].
* No real exports or farmland save for personal kitchen gardens, for those with family to take care of them or laurels to sit on, and time to waste.
* Home of the notable wizard Fulbairn in his old age.
* No inn, but a bakery which brews on the side, inadvertently dodging the new tax set up by [[Eustace II]].
* Plagued (or not) by the debauchery of Fulbairn, who is driving half of the village into jealousy, and they plot his undoing.
* They proposition the party to solve the problem of Fulbairnâ€™s depravity in a more permanent manner, and complain also of the Jyke Estate on the edge of the village.
