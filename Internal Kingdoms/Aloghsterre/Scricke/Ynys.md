- [ˈɪˈnɪs](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%CB%88pl%C9%9Bhca&voice=Dora), inis, Cornish for island
- Isolationist and insular faith in worship of a conceptual god of security and constance.
- Symbolised through iconography of crabs - while crabs are not revered, there is superstition that eating one can cause infertility and stillbirth in regions of the world where worship takes place.
- Temples are constructed as standing rows of pillars, where those who oppose or stand against the faith's tenets are strung to and flogged.
- For one of these pillars to crumble and fall is deemed a very ill omen and can cause communities to completely shut off ties with the outside world in fear of retribution.
- Such fears are far from unfounded, Ynys is cruel and dominative, focusing far more on conserving worshipping communities through fear and control as opposed to bounty and gifts.
- Those settlements that do embrace new thought or neighbourhood find themselves forsaken by their faith, or even damned by plagues brought about intentionally, knowing this would lead to their repentance and return to the faith.
- Scarcely acted during [[The Conquests]], embarking on none themselves.
- Have little in the way of designs, the faiths isolationism and stubbornness are characterised, leading to little interaction with the world and other faith, as a scheme would ultimately lead to change
## Ynys' Precepts
* To open thy door to the needy leads to trespass from the invader.
* To open thy heart to the unfamiliar leaves the seed of destruction in thy womb.
* To open thy mind to the unknown spurs only madness within.
* To open thy books to the foolish grants them the knowledge to see thee undone.
* To open thy circle to the unwelcome sees the ring forever broken.
