#aloghsterre 
* Near-dead town ravaged by lycanthropy, at the behest of [[Ynys]] following the towns acceptance of [[Pauscht Caravan]]'s "medicine" unbeknownst to both the town and the faith to be little more than snake-oil.
- The town accepted the caravan’s blood-based tinctures in a desperate attempt to cure the bouts of an unknown wasting disease that was slowly bringing the town into ruin.
- As a result [[Ynys]] cursed the vials, leading to the towns emaciated citizens to develop lycanthropy, transforming into haggard [[Scrikian Lycanthropes]].
- Now the town slowly crumbles, dead in the day and echoing with maddening howls during the night.
## Layout
- The town is bordered by *Quarry cliff* to the north and *Cran hill* to the east. The cliffs were bored into during the quarrying to construct the town's southern wall. The cluster of houses around this north-eastern section are homes for the quarrymen.
- To the west, *Greel stream* flows down from the *Quarry cliffs*, at a waterfall and crossing. The road from this crossing leads to the diminutive *Cliffside gate*, which is seldom used.
- Immediately past this gate lies *Scrike hall*, which handled much of the cities affairs.
- Past the hall lies *The Halved Fiddler*, the inn of Scrike, and residential areas.
- Here, in the centre of town, lies the *Temple of Ynys*, ornamental and bearing its stark pillars, to which some of the feral ne'er-do-wells lie chained even today, alongside vast tablets displaying *Ynys' Precepts*.
- From the temple, the south-western road takes you to the *Southern gatehouse*, and the south-eastern road takes you to the *Cran Gatehouse*.
- Heading north takes you to the base of *Quarry cliffs*, *Quarrymen’s homes*, and the *Quarry depot*.
At the quarry can be found *Tin Tunnel*, *[[Grove & Hadh Tunnel]]*, and the collapsed *East Tunnel*.
