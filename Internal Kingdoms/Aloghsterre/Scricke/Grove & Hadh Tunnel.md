* Grone & Hadh are a pair of half-orc sisters who leased land rights to the base of Quarry Cliff in [[Scrike]] from [[Eustace II]], believing it to be a steal as the insular nature of the town was concealed from them.
* Once they arrived in town, they soon realised their mistake but had to venture forth anyway, effectively having to set up depots prior to acquiring a workforce, as the town went out of their way to hamper their progress, often leading to written warnings from his lordship.
* After the potential spot for the quarry lay dormant for months, a wet summer in the region led to poor harvest and many in the township were forced to undertake work for the sisters in exchange for wages.
* **Secret**: In reality, it was [[Ynys]] who caused the wet summer as punishment for not outright killing the two outsiders. There is a certain lack of understanding of consequence amongst the divine judgement of that faith.
* Now the quarry was started and the sisters began to recoup their losses, overseeing the project personally.
* When the Lycanthropy plague began to hit the town, some of quarry groups ended up holed up in the tunnel, surviving miserably on hardbread from the depot.
* Fearing blame from the townsfolk, Grone & Hadh use their extensive knowledge of the tunnels as leverage amongst the townsfolk, but food is running scarce and patience is wearing thin, and the two sisters fear it shall be them who are sent on the first scavenging runâ€¦
