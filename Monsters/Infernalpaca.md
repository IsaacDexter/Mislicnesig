- With fur of red and orange hue that seems to dance and flicker in the wind and black teeth like nubs of charcoal, the Infernalpaca is a beast that is easy to rile but far harder to extinguish. The ground where this camelid steps is scorched black, and its spit can start wildfires. It is vulnerable to cold damage, however, and its sheared fur can act as brilliant fireproofing.
