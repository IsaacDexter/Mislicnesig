#history 
* 814 YS to 952 YS.
* There was still some religious strife and warfare between [[Mislicnesig]] and neighbouring lands, but more so within [[Mislicnesig]], as their gods incited their followers to conflict to gain believers.
* This was hardly all out war for a hundred years, but intermittent military campaigns to strike their foes at their weakest.
* Some religions were all but destroyed, warlike religions gained prominence.
* Even peaceful gods were forced to rally their people to defend their lands lest they be killed and belief lost.
* These conflicts led rise to an increase in seafaring technology, to fight battles more efficiently.
* This led rise to migration and the introduction of more religions from far off lands, as well as vice versa.
* Fearing the power of other landsâ€™ religions and being outnumbered, gods pleaded for the combat to cease
