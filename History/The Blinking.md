#history 
* 477 YS to 750 YS.
* Following the disappearance of The Prince under Starlight, theology was once again rising to prominence.
* Followers needed something to believe in now their prince had left, the land was split as once-lords became kings and kingdoms shrunk.
* Once-counties became kingdoms within the land, bloodshed broke out as these lords shattered their allegiances to The Prince under Starlight and his fey allies and vied for power.
* Borne of these conflicts was desperation, and a need for belief - gods that were scarcely believed in the Reign of Starlight became engorged on this hope and began rising back to power.
* Factions within the lands led to factions between religions - and the splitting of beliefs: gods had to manage sects, and certain gods that were incepted during this time were simply misinterpretations of old gods.
* Little history and research was recorded, the time was a bloody clash for hundreds of years as heirs took over and kingdoms finally began to settle.
* This infighting continued to a lesser degree during  as advances in naval technology led to overseas religious warfare
