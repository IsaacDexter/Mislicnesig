* 750 YS to 814 YS.
* Though short, this time was bloody and ceased after catastrophic loss of soldiers in the wars.
* Roughly halved the population of [[Mislicnesig]].
* Gods grew greedy with the prospect of taking neighbouring lands they took to be atheist, but which were in reality home to a great many other infighting religions.
* These religions were introduced through declaration of war - gods scarcely knew who they were fighting and it led to a great deal of strife.
* Eventually, the gods saw there could be little gained in fighting overseas and focused their attention inland, leading to a time of lesser strife, though certainly not of peace.
