#history 
* 952 YS to 1104 YS (Present).
* With combat ceased out of the gods fear of defeat, they instead vied to gain belief in new lands and strengthen themselves in old.
* Far more civil and cordial, though certain warlike gods insist still on crusades.
* Alliances formed in home territories against foreign [[Faith]] that came with immigration, but people came and people spread .
* To gain belief, gods employ miracles, apostles, acts of mercy, grant sainthood and prodigy to new people .
* As such, there is almost no atheism in the world, as the gods often walk among us and grant blessing.
* Cordiality between the gods has increased also, with envoys and even embassies and consulates in some of the stronger alliances.
* This is the current period, a time of relative peace - many fractured gods form and are often subsequently quelled through missionaries as migrants misremember and reinterpret ideology
