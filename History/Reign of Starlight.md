#history 
* 0 YS to 477 YS.
* [[The Starlit Prince]] emerged with unparalleled and inconceivable magic, rose to power and prominence, uniting the lands.
* It was a time of peace. The prince-turned-king was so great no one could hope to dethrone him, nor did anyone want to: he was a wise and benevolent king who brought progress and unity to the lands.
* Progress and unity between the material plane and kingdoms within [[Faerie]] grew as the king made alliances and built roads and bastions in these lands.
* Great magical progress ensued also, The Prince trained students, [[The Three Colleges]] were founded and a great many books were penned. It can be said it was The Prince who brought magic to prominence upon the isle.
* Most gods dwindled to embers, and many were extinguished: folks had no need to believe in a god when the selfless prince could perform miracles for them.
* The Prince never waged war against gods, there was simply little need for them and they dwindled.
* Warlocks under the patronage of The [[Unseen]] were subject to thorough inquisitions, and were purged almost entirely from the realm. Books and churches in their honour were destroyed and what impact they had on the realm was all but severed.
* Little knowledge of the details of this persecution are remembered - many of the modern age think in terms of gods and account this purging to that of a godâ€™s believers.
* Until one day, The Prince vanished and The Glass Throne in [[Aloghsterre#Wag Gleomu]] was left shattered, old lords broke into conflict to claim lands, but the land was not to be united under a single banner for countless years.
* Deified versions of The Prince, such as the one worshipped by [[The Starlit Prince]], grew as gods themselves depending on the beliefs of those who served him.
* The alliances with [[Fairies]] were no longer held and the old roads were abandoned as folks on both grew wary .
* [[Fairies]] feared the vying lords and withdrew alliances to the material plane.
* Some folk will tell stories of seeing the prince ride still, but to this day no-one knows where he went
