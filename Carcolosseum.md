- A giant, travelling colosseum, boasting combat, carnivals and camaraderie, all carved into the back of a [[Mammoth Crab]], [[#Clushy]].
- The crab is kept tamed, with its claws bound.
- The colosseum features fights to the death, be it folks or beasts. Those lucky victors are showered with rewards and luxury (though rarely freedom)
- Those not-so lucky losers are fed to Clushy.
- The colosseum and general festivities are organised by [[Cleo De Benfro]], ringleader and carouser, who inherited Clushy from her father, [[#Admiral Aniston De Benfro]].
- Clushy was wrangled by Aniston and his crew on his ship in 
# Clushy 
- When aggravated, **DC 20 STR** to break Clushy's bonds, which prevent it from using *claw*. 
- The giant crab upon which the Carcolosseum was constructed
- Originally captured by [[#Admiral Aniston De Benfro]], who intended to utilize Clushy as an "mobile fortress", with men and weaponry stashed on the ridges of it's shell
	- This was a complete disaster, and Clushy proved impossible to control, costing many weapons and taking lives
	- Aniston's title was stripped, which led to his downward spiral, his daughter, [[Cleo De Benfro]], overtook affairs and transformed Clushy into the Carcolosseum 
# Admiral Aniston De Benfro
* Disgraced admiral of the [[Regal Consortium of Pulit-Aspell]], in their overfinanced, chaotic, out of control navy.
* Essentially tried to wrangle [[#Clushy]] and use him as a mobile weapons platform, ended up eating some of the soldiers it was carrying.
* Was disgraced and stripped of his title, but the navy is a shambles - he kept the crab, and gave it to his daughter, [[Cleo De Benfro]], as inheritance.
