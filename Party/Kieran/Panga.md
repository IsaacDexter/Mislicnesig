Unknown: Mother, captive Djinni of a mortal grants captors wish to have a genasi child. She is freed by rebelling Djinni who kill the father and take her back to the Plane of Air. She later gives birth and the child is tossed back in to the Material plane by the Djinni due to its human appearance. She is killed for her perceived crimes. Known: Found on the streets of a very small, religious human mountain town as a newborn, strangely walking even though obviously still newborn. Taken in by town elder and raised with help from town. Boisterous and mischevious childhood, gaining apt reputation for disruptive nature, however never boiling over as still well natured and honest. As Panga progressed through childhood the town start to grow concerned, his hair remained icy white and his skin started to turn blue as his genasi fatures become more prominent. As his distinctive deep blue lines start to appear the town decide he is not holy(?)/not welcome so outcast/try to kill man by yeeting off mountain. They kill the elder on suspicion of witchcraft(?). Panga then proceeds to live in the wilds of the mountains where he forms his barbarian roots, surviving purely off intuition, instinct and a ghostly ability to navigate through the heights of the trees. He eventually settles in a cave high in the mountain peaks, the cave is in a seemingly unreachable place however on arrival Panga discovers the distant remains of a camp. (Belonging to an earth genasi that lived there years ago) Panga then decides to leave due to his boredom, smuggling himself on to the first transportation going out of the region Pirate ship
