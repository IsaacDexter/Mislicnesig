# [[Daegan]]
You worship the god Daegan, the secret god, and god of secrets. Daegan's followers are not some secret society who meet under cover of night - in fact, they don't know each other at all. Worship of Daegan is kept under such wraps that it is done only when solitary, and no one ever announces their faith, even to other suspected worshipers.

Daegan's principles are simple. Using a series of secret markings and codes, followers leave encoded clues and pieces of information for other worshipers to follow. The general idea is, that by all secretly helping one another, all of you prosper, but without knowledge of who is helping who.

While your family never outwardly spoke in support of Daegan around you, they might have influenced your coming to the religion: perhaps they left a certain book out in the library, or a few markings out in the open. Alternatively, your family never knew about Daegan whatsoever, and you stumbled upon the faith in another manner, it's entirely up to you. Either way, no-one was able to directly induct you into the religion.

# High Society
## Urban Life
High society in [[Mislicnesig]] is petty and conflicted. Families vie for small regions of rural control. The lack of any real urban life on the island makes politics less centralized. Rivalries are bitter and longstanding between families, and espionage and sabotage are rife. Ultimately, each family is in it for their own ends, and squabbling between and amongst families is common.

There are only a couple of developed urbanized areas in Mislicnesig - a great number of towns litter the landscape, but they are usually rural and feudally controlled by a family or another faction. A few cities that you might know of include:
- [[Aloghsterre]], the capital.
- [[Muttam Hall]], a swampy, [[dragonborn]] city to the north, in [[Attermoor]]
- Pulit-Aspell, a newer, wealthy city to the east, in [[Kitterland]]
- Asquer, a city of old wealth to the south, in [[Tawdyrge]]
This is not an exhaustive list, but urban centres are few and far between. 
## Rummies
In your dealings in high society you may have met Rummies, students of an economics school in the capital called the Royal University of Magic, or RUM. They're sort of the equivalent of Old Etonians. The higher echelons of mercantile society are exclusive, and controlled for the most part by Rummies, who only allow other Rummies to join.

Rummies are pompous and self absorbed, and usually of old wealth.
