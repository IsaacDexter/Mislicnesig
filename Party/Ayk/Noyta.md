#faction
- Collective of roaming peoples indebted to [[The Starlit Prince]]
- Faction of [[The Starlit Prince]]
- Sworn to the Prince's ideals of unity, peace, and togetherness, Noyta roam the lands, hoping to diffuse conflict before it divides the once unified [[Mislicnesig]] even further
- Their ultimate goal is the reunification of the isle and a restoration of the peace that once prospered
- Not necessarily pushy with the 'worship the prince' aspect, more so with the 'don't fight' part of the prince's teachings
