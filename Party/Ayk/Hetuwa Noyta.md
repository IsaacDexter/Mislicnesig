- Solo roaming person
- Part of a larger collective of roaming peoples, [[Noyta]]
- A branch of [[The Starlit Prince]], they follow [[The Starlit Prince]]'s teachings preach peace
- Roams the lands to diffuse conflict
- Left collective on pilgrimage to [[Aloghsterre]].
- Feels separate from Noyta following the death of his sister and nephew - it is tough to face your family when those closest to you have passed. Subsequently somewhat of a lone wolf from Noyta
