# The Prince's Cult
* Worshippers of a deified version of [[The Starlit Prince]], believing he shall one day return and reunite the kingdom of [[Mislicnesig]].
* Though much of the following centres in [[Aloghsterre]], [[Aloghsterre#Stewards]] make no attempt to crush it, and some have even believed in it themselves.
	* The position of steward is some birthright, and they fear losing grip on what little power they would have should they forsake [[The Starlit Prince]].
	* Besides, each of the inhabitants of [[Mislicnesig]] holds some hope their prince shall one day return.
* Many followers have been driven to dissent and protest following the insulation of [[Aloghsterre]] and in turn [[The Three Colleges]], which they see (perhaps not incorrectly) as direct contradiction of [[The Starlit Prince]]'s will.
# The True Prince
* The Starlit Prince's true self following his disappearance.
* The deified prince worshipped by [[The Starlit Prince]] (and, to an extent, [[The Pretender]]) are deities born of the belief in the perceptions of who [[The Starlit Prince]] was, this is the actual Prince-turned-king, following his departure from the realms.
* Warlocks serving him ([[#Starlit Servants]]) move in secrecy and are almost entirely unknown - there are very few in existence, and his patronage is only offered to those that have showed themselves as both exceptionally powerful and noble .
* They aid The Prince in his eternal mission of defending the realm from the conquests of the [[Unseen]] - the ultimate goal is that of impenetrable magical defences that will last till the end of time. This is not a rushed task - The Prince made himself immortal, and performs his task slowly.
* Those in his patronage are tasked with hunting those in the patronage of the [[Unseen]], as well as assisting in his laborious magic to fortify the defences. They move in secrecy and are scarcely seen.
* The Prince misses his rule of his land, and occasionally visits in a disguised corporeal form, but never intervenes as his task is too great and he can afford no distractions.
* Once his monumental task is complete, he will return to his throne of glass and rule his kingdom once more
