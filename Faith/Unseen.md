* Perpetuates, Old Ones, Unseen.
* The patrons of warlocks, scarcely talked about, shunned and powerful.
* Not gods or deities, something entirely different and far more ancient - belief does not affect them, and they do not use people to wage their wars for them.
* They would prey on the material plane if it weren't for [[The Starlit Prince]]'s defences against their intervention. The defenders are not impenetrable, however, and some warlocks still hold patronage from these entities..
* The older gods, who may be aware of these beings, are afraid of them, but not paranoid - they understand they are being kept at bay by something. Some inquisitive gods may send their followers to investigate these defences, to little success. .
* Unfathomably powerful, but only a minute speck of their strength is granted to their warlock followers as they do not see this realm as a worthy endeavour .
* Warlocks are universally shunned due to the religious nature of the realm, and the gods fear of their patrons.
* The [[The Starlit Prince#Starlit Servants]] act to nullify these threats as an unseen force in the world. 
* [[The Starlit Prince]]'s defences are focused on the exclusion of these meddling forces, and it was why he abandoned his post, which in turn led to [[The Blinking]].
