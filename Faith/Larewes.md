The **Lawares** are a diverse grouping of craftsman gods that have evolved into a loose pantheon. When early human and dwarven settlers came to the south, They began to innovate, using the rich resources to develop crafts and industry. Although native elven and gnomish populations were initially cautious and sceptical, they applied their talent, longevity and appreciation for beauty to the new crafts, and developed the regional system of apprenticeship. Those rare craftsmen who mastered their skills gained much prestige, and eventually evolved into legendary and subsequently deified figures. Lineage in apprenticeship to these masters continues to this day, and is the basis of the **Larewes** belief.
