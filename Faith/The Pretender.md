* Ayle Hermand (459 YS to 502 YS).
* A pretender who came to [[Aloghsterre]] in 501 YS during a time of strife, claiming to be [[The Starlit Prince]], come again to reclaim his glass throne.
* He was immediately cast out of the city followed by laughter.
	* The inhabitants of the capital had met [[The Starlit Prince]] and knew his mannerisms: while Ayle did indeed look in likeness of the king, he behaved with patience and understanding - completely unlike the king's quick-wittedness and drive.
* Instead he headed to the nearby settlement of [[Oakenhead]] to recruit followers.
* This would likely also have been to no avail, were it not for an individual he happened to meet upon the road.
* Stood at the mouth of one of [[The Routes Between]] was a fey, unbeknownst to him to be [[Red Mollie]], offering charms, costume and [[Fairy Wine]] (a drink of the nobility) which Ayle could use to convince the people of [[Oakenhead]] of his false identity.
	* Most of all he was gifted with rings of wonderous [[Signetstone]], which he could use to truly impersonate [[The Starlit Prince]].
* Ayle accepted her help hesitantly, suspecting her of being a fairy, and ventured to [[Oakenhead]] in guise.
* With the help of her charms, the town was enraptured, and celebrated and praised Ayle for his perceived return.
* [[Red Mollie]] sought to guide Ayleâ€™s hand, and had him bring significance once more to the defunct mouths to [[The Routes Between]], concocting elaborate ceremonies in order to further her own goals in the mortal lands.
