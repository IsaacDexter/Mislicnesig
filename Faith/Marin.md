#faith
* Seafaring goddess, beloved by sailors and [[Marauders]].
* Her miracles often centre around fair weather and winds - she helps sailors out of storms, to outrun sea monsters and to catch up to their enemies.
* Chaotic Neutral, she lives for the thrill of the life of a seaman and helps accommodate it.
* She never claims to protect the lives of the needy, but certainly aims to make their getaway more dramatic.
* Her ambition is of the seas, and she cares not the land - her faith is spread through the tall tales she accommodates.
* Hers is one of the only faiths kind to the [[Faith#Small Gods]] - she cares only for the sea and sees land as territory of others.
* Worship is done through party and celebration, the tossing of drinks overboard, and the carving of her likeness into figureheads and onto islands where treasure is buried.
