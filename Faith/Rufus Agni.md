Villainous cult leader trying to game the faith system to secure himself from eternal damnation in the afterlife. He was born to a solitary mother who worshipped [[Ndjell]]. She was a concubine to [[Kadva Kahv]] earlier in his looting, but she escaped while pregnant, before the tyrant found out. Kadva is unaware of his sons' existence, but Rufus knows.
Ndjell resents him for not stepping up and claiming his father's little empire, which he did initially out of fear of responsibility and recognition of its impermanence. The goddess did not play for the long term however, and saw only the promise of adoration and influence. As such, he is plagued by her malcontentedness, and sentenced to damnation in the afterworld.
Out of fear of this damnation, Agni applied his charisma to leverage intellectuals to divulge what they've learnt from the study of religion, and acts to leverage his charisma to form his own following, where he can exist in happiness following his death.
His plan is flawed, however - his faith was more a cult of personality, and his death will lead to its dissolution, after which who knows what will await him and the other poor souls whose afterlives disintegrate around them. Also, the lack of substance in his religion has led to inconsistencies in his faith.
