- Ancient Elven goddess of the long-forgotten province that one day became [[Tawdyrge]]
- She is a god of the wilds and bounty, and prizes those who defend the honour of her lands
- Her followers are not to rake the land, but instead treat it with dignity and respect, and take only what is required, living in harmony
- Their only true enemies are those who transgress on her lands by transforming them - while commercial huntsmen may be frowned upon, one must fell land and burn trees to make an enemy of the goddess’ followers
- In return, she blesses her followers with visions of bounty in times of need, with knowledge of the land in her sleep, and the skills to navigate the land from the earth
# Saint Vaul
- Achieved Sainthood of Gelwaré after fighting transgressors who attempted to denude the forests of [[Carévessa]]

**Gelwaré**, the spirit of the vast forest of Carevessa, presides over rural, nomadic communities and conclaves. She is of the oldest gods of Tawrdyrge: land deities and river spirits who are said to have presided in the region long before settlement. Worship is tribal and ritualistic, involving ceremonial burnings, animal sacrifice, and displays of devotion to sacred and sublime natural features.

Her followers are traditional, cautious and quick tempered. Although they were persecuted to some extent as pagans, the defence of their holy sites has turned to violent conflict, and these people are considered both a danger and an enemy to both the industrious **Larewes** and the opulent **Lyons**.
