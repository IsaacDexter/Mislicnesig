#faith
- Ancient Elven goddess of the long-forgotten province that one day became [[Tawdyrge]]
- She is a god of the wilds and bounty, and prizes those who defend the honour of her lands
- Her followers are not to rake the land, but instead treat it with dignity and respect, and take only what is required, living in harmony
- Their only true enemies are those who transgress on her lands by transforming them - while commercial huntsmen may be frowned upon, one must fell land and burn trees to make an enemy of the goddess’ followers
- In return, she blesses her followers with visions of bounty in times of need, with knowledge of the land in her sleep, and the skills to navigate the land from the earth
# Saint Vaul
