* High nobles of the courts of [[Faerie]] - not gods or deities, just powerful, immortal [[Fairies]].
* Like all fey, their motives are mysterious and hard to grasp. Some wish to reinstate old alliances with mortals, others wish for isolation and separation from them - without a common goal, there isn't a tremendous amount accomplished for any significant amount of time.
* Some archfey express interest in god and belief - [[Fairies]] are too chaotic and fickle to regularly express true belief in gods, so the gods have little interest in [[Faerie]] - even through conquering, there is no power to be gained.
* Their most devoted of followers, warlock or not, are capable of traversing into fey easily through the old roads.
* Faeries are their own world, with their own conflicts and struggles. Such conflicts abide by different rules, and associated warlocks can often find themselves called to perform assistive duties in the material plane.
* These warlocks are better treated than [[Unseen]], especially in areas with good relationships with [[Faerie]], such as those who follow [[The Starlit Prince]], as they remember the old alliances.
