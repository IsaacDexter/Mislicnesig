1. The party departs [[Oakenhead]] for [[Aloghsterre]].
2. The party arrive at the [[Larlen#Crossroads|crossroads]] outside [[Larlen]], where they meet a painter, [[Larlen#Ness|Ness]]. She is painting [[Larlen#Theth|Theth]], a dying god in a cage.
	2. There are no signs on the signpost. Ness suggests the party search a fifth track, which leads to [[Larlen#Goblin University|Goblin University]]. She rightly suspects the Goblins have stolen Theth's plaque.
3. The party arrive at the University and make their way to the arena to witness a fight between a [[Larlen#Crusher|Crusher]] (a rust monster), and a blink dog.
4. At the fights conclusion, they convince [[Larlen#Gary|Gary]] to part with the plaque and signpost.
5. The restless spirits, followers of Theth, panic at the threat to the plaque and mistime the springing of a trap, releasing Crusher.
6. Gary is enraged at Crusher's defeat. He attempts to fight the party, but is interrupted.
7. The restless spirits seize the opportunity to take control of the signpost and reanimate crusher.
	1. The sky clouds like in Ness' painting. Blood rains. Crows descend, still clutching at pieces of Theth, and peck holes in Crushers corpse.
	2. The exposed wounds and blood provide a conduit for Theth to control the lifeless body and obtain the plaque.
8. The party fight with the reanimated crusher, and release the animals within the arena to their aid.
	1. Crusher speaks to the party in the gurgling, coagulated voice of Theth, demanding the plaque.
9. Crusher falls, the spirts are now powerless. They have made their last stand, ironically against those seeking to help them.
	1. The goblins are ecstatic at the party's victory, proclaiming it to be a spectacle.
	2. The ghost continue to use the last of their power to haunt the leaving party. The goblins are excitedly jabbering about Theth and wishing to evoke such power in further battles.
	3. The spirits are energetic. It is still raining blood. Crows fly rapidly back and forth overhead.
10. The party return to Ness. She is in a flurry, having witnessed Theth's power being channelled.
	1. Theth stands tall in her cage, crows circling overhead. They do not peck at her. Blood spills from the floor of the cage. She is merciful to the party for wishing to help her, but neither forgiving nor thankful. She can now leave this cage, fuelled by the belief of Larlen's new residents.
	2. Ness' painting is electric, capturing the essence of the event. She is frightened of her families legacy, but enamoured also. She wishes to paint the ruins of Larlen, but wishes the party well on the way to the capital.
