# Prologue
## The Prince and Fairyland
1. The Starlit Prince forged alliances with Fairyland so that he could secretly transport goods and troops into enemy territory using The Routes Between, old warpaths left over from the Holly King's invasion of Mislicnesig.
2. Fearing his mortality, the Prince did not rest even after unifying Mislicnesig, instead devoting to the occult study of celestials, in the hopes of ascension to godhood: an ascension he completed, though not with the results he expected, instead finding himself bent to the whims of the populace through his cult, the Starlit Servants.
3. Following the Prince's disappearance, the fairy alliance's chief players, The Vintner's Company and Jeweller's Company, grew hungry with ambition and gradually fell under the control of Red Mollie, head vintner and mistress of the Prince.
4. Having established itself as a dynasty, The Vintner's Company kidnaps mortal virgins to barter as brides to established fairy houses, thereby forging a fairy empire that seeks to recreate the Hollytide and place the Red Queen on the glass throne.
## Godhood
1. The Mirequeen, Ghut, garnered such faith from her followers that she transcended into godhood, and lived on long past her murder by Mad Aln, and even past the emancipation of her thralls.
2. Ghut's attempts at ascension shook the divine order, driving the greater holies to persecute the petty gods seen otherwise as of little threat.
3. Inspired by Ghut's success, infernal demons sought to harness the ambition and malleability of mortals to puppet an ascended mortal deity. They sponsored the Prince, fostering his desire to rule Mislicnesig, and granting him the power to do so.
4. Following the Prince's ascension, they sowed the seeds of fear in the Prince's mind, and drove him to pursue godhood and ascension.
