*Coat of Arms of Wyke*
# Geography
Wyke is a open and flat wetland. The thick, deep forest of **Carevessa** dominates the east. The river **Wyke** flows from central **Addermouth** to the southern cove of **Pearwick**. The eastern border follows the rivers of **Baddon**, **Lesser Canterel**, and **Lacus**. The southern coast is made of treacherous cliffs, while the northern coast meets a coastal straight, the **Kirry**, as a low plain or machair.

Wyke is in short supply of arable soil, so supplies its crops and red meat from neighbouring territories. Boar and game are hunted in Carevessa, although efforts to clear the woodland for the purposes of farming are met with strong hostility from its inhabitants, the followers of **Gelwaré**.
# Climate
River monsters, creatures that lurk in the mud, marsh zombies, terror birds are of the most threatening fauna to the south. The marshes are dangerously haunted. The southern sea is completely inhospitable, with the jagged cliffs being notorious nesting spots for harpies. The waters there are deep, and home to vast sea monsters. The northern coast, however, is very peaceful, making the Kirry Strait the only viable path to the sea.
# Politics
The barony of Wyke is leased to the reclusive Thraske family. Twin Dwarven sisters **Azalea** and **Vireya** have been Baronesses Thraske for the last 70 years. They each lack an heir, although Azalea has a Tiefling husband, Rhodes. They rarely make public appearances, but their office is popular, having secured many lucrative trade contracts with cities both inside and outside of Tawdyrge, as well as funding the construction of a great number of cultural centres. The twins are pale and fair haired, and Azalea is atypically tall.
# The Guard
The Wyke Guard are responsible for the safety of all citizens of Wyke, in addition to being a tempered and respected army. Members of the guard are trained rigorously, and to reach the status of protector is no small feat. Upon reaching this high post, protectors are granted armour, lodgings in the city and are sworn to the oaths of **Lyons**, swearing their allegiance to the god-city. They are typically sent on external assignments, blazoned in the blue and gold of Wyke, perhaps to ensure cooperation from some great merchant, or to quench **Gelwaré**'s violent dissenters.
# City of Wyke
While not the capital of Tawdyrge, Wyke is a city of wealth, pedigree and beauty. The city is built atop lofty bridges, with terraced gardens and cascading water features. The waters of the Wyke are drawn all the way to tallest peaks of the city for bathhouses and gardens. Although the city is not walled, it is secure - the natural crook of the Wyke provides a natural barrier on all sides. The three lofty bridges (**North**, **Mile**, and **Spring**) act as the only entry points to the town, and are well guarded. Without constricting walls, the city has sprawled over the countryside.

The city is tiered. The high centre is home of judiciaries, wealthy merchants, and famed magicians: the upper echelons of Tawdyrge society. They reside in dazzling houses, with intricately designed gardens. Surrounding these properties are boutiques, dining houses, and cultural centres, such as the famed **Currence Opera House**, which features such elaborate waterworks such that artificial rivers can be drawn across the stage.

Below these peaks is home to countless waterwheels, potters' studios and hydroponic gardens for the growing of delicate spices and magical ingredients. The constant grumble of the humungous wooden wheels gives this industrious downtown its name: "The Grindstone". The lower town, while busy and noisy, does also take its share of Wyke's affluence. It buzzes like a hive.

The outskirts of the city are flat, and take up stony platforms towards the centre of the river, or reside on the less sodden patches of ground. Fishing, harvesting of slip and clay, and reed farming are common livelihoods in these parts. These common folk still live a good life in the city's shadow, and are treated with dignity by all but the elite. The guard is stretched thin over the wide expanse of Wyke's outskirts - even without walls, the city is protected from external threats, but the looming presence of Gelwaré puts people on edge, and religious dissidents have sacked and burned several of the smaller boroughs.

# Baddoncaster
Baddoncaster is a large castle town that defends the eastern border. Relations with The Bishops of Canter were hostile right up until their destruction at the close of The War of Robes, an ancient War between The Bishops of Canter (a sect of religious heretics), and an alliance of Gnollwall (now Porthwall), Tawdyrge (now Tawburne), and Wyke. The peers that came to replace the bishops have remained cooperative since their instatement, making the castle a superfluous defence.
# Kilnford
Kilnford, the home of bone pottery, is an artisanal town to the east, at the confluence of the **Lesser Canterel**, **Lacus**, and **Greater Canterel**. **Laweres** has an unshakable presence in the town, and is the ancestral home of bone pottery in Mislicnesig. Consequently, the town is affluent and influential. The town's architecture is without peer, owing to its unique decorated terracotta houses, ceramic statues, and fragrant rose gardens. 
# The Vessa
The Vessa is a nearby woodland settlement to the east. Proclaimed "The Jewel of Carevessa", The Vessa is a stunning example of Wood-Elf treetop architecture, owing to its unique build of suspended screens of woven flax, with ornate ceramic detailing. Auteurs of art, music and writing, its hidden community was once heralded throughout the land as a place of peace and art. Now, however, the zealous violence stoked by the urbanisation of Tawdyrge and the clearing of Carevessa has led to it being considered as harbouring terrorists. All out war on the city is yet to be declared, but tensions are high, and **House Asquer** is yet to intervene.
# Vaul's Cross
Vaul's Cross is a bridge town that fords the **Kirry**. It's namesake was **St. Vaul**, a legendary paladin of Gelwaré, who fought back riders from Folahethe, and ridded the straight of sea-raiders. Religious tensions have lead to the town being considered cursed because of its connection. St. Vaul is said to still patrol Tawdyrge, aiding those who seek to preserve its wilderness.
# Getton Gowt
Getton Gowt is an ruined harbour town to the south. When the south sea became treacherous centuries ago, it was abandoned, and **Vaul's Cross** became Wyke's primary harbour.
