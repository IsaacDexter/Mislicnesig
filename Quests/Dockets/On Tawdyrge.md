Tawdyrge is Mislicnesig's southernmost kingdom, a sprawling domain of rivers and sandy coasts. It is comprised of seven distinct territories:
- **Wyke**, a wealthy urban region made fat on the bounty of *Carevessa*, a vast forest it bisects.
- **Warenhull**, cut up between thick woodland and exposed coasts.
- **Tawburne**, seat of the regent and a sodden wetland.
- **Canter**, innovators of boatbuilding and navigation.
- **Oysterpool**, a hive of industry held aloft by it's clay riverbeds and growing ceramics trade.
- **Porthwall**, whose large sarsens make it the ancestral home of masons and sculptors.
- **Nothwold**, a dwindling state encroached on by riders of the north and Tawburne's influence.
# Politics
Tawdyrge is a Regency, ruled by deep-rooted and prestigious *Asquer* family, descendants of the Old Kings of Laweres, ancestral rulers of the south. The territories within Tawdyrge are fiefs, divvied between the baronage, a collection of the most wealthy and influential families. These fiefs are further split, and sub-managed by the peerage, well-to-do families operating on a local level.

Outside of the populous cities, however, the grip of the lords is strained. Ancient druidic circles oppose the opportunistic lords and seek to preserve the ancient crafts that defined the lands. It is a time of unrest in the countryside, but urbanites are shielded from the tumult by high walls, profitable trade, and self absorbtion.
