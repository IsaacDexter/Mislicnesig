![[Tawdyrge.png]]
Tawdyrge is Mislicnesig's southernmost kingdom, a sprawling domain of rivers and sandy coasts. It is comprised of seven distinct territories:
- **Wyke**, a wealthy urban region made fat on the bounty of *Carevessa*, a vast forest it bisects.
- **Warenhull**, cut up between thick woodland and exposed coasts.
- **Tawburne**, seat of the regent and a sodden wetland.
- **Canter**, innovators of boatbuilding and navigation.
- **Oysterpool**, a hive of industry held aloft by it's clay riverbeds and growing ceramics trade.
- **Porthwall**, whose large sarsens make it the ancestral home of masons and sculptors.
- **Nothwold**, a dwindling state encroached on by riders of the north and Tawburne's influence.
# Politics
Tawdyrge is a Regency, ruled by deep-rooted and prestigious *Asquer* family, descendants of the Old Kings of Laweres, ancestral rulers of the south. The territories within Tawdyrge are fiefs, divvied between the baronage, a collection of the most wealthy and influential families. These fiefs are further split, and sub-managed by the peerage, well-to-do families operating on a local level.

Outside of the populous cities, however, the grip of the lords is strained. Ancient druidic circles oppose the opportunistic lords and seek to preserve the ancient crafts that defined the lands. It is a time of unrest in the countryside, but urbanites are shielded from the tumult by high walls, profitable trade, and deceitful, reassuring voices from those above them.

In spite of these hardships, the Asquer family do nothing. They are said to be cowering in their mansions, chewing their nails to the quick, lame in the face of danger. But these are just rumours, and the Lords of Tawdyrge ensure rumours die quickly.
# Religion
Three generations of godhood clash for control of this little region. 
## Gelwaré
**Gelwaré**, the spirit of the vast forest of Carevessa, presides over rural, nomadic communities and conclaves. She is of the oldest gods of Tawrdyrge: land deities and river spirits who are said to have presided in the region long before settlement. Worship is tribal and ritualistic, involving ceremonial burnings, animal sacrifice, and displays of devotion to sacred and sublime natural features.

Her followers are traditional, cautious and quick tempered. Although they were persecuted to some extent as pagans, the defence of their holy sites has turned to violent conflict, and these people are considered both a danger and an enemy to both the industrious **Larewes** and the opulent **Lyons**.
## Larewes
The **Lawares** are a diverse grouping of craftsman gods that have evolved into a loose pantheon. When early human and dwarven settlers came to the south, They began to innovate, using the rich resources to develop crafts and industry. Although native elven and gnomish populations were initially cautious and sceptical, they applied their talent, longevity and appreciation for beauty to the new crafts, and developed the regional system of apprenticeship. Those rare craftsmen who mastered their skills gained much prestige, and eventually evolved into legendary and subsequently deified figures. Lineage in apprenticeship to these masters continues to this day, and is the basis of the **Larewes** belief.

Followers are committed, studious and rigorous. They practice and train others in a traditional school of craft for a given trade. Worship is practiced as oaths to the great schools, individual mastery, and a commitment to develop the trade with each further generation. Great markets and trade fairs are held in the masters' honour, and commemorative pieces are commissioned in reverence and for practice.

Relations between **Larewes** and **Lyons** is friendly and cooperative, as both hold the crafts in great reverence. Tensions only regularly arise in regards to utility and technique, versus opulence and veneer. Tensions towards **Gelwaré** are high, though less violent, as **Larewes** are less hasty and destructive to the environment as **Lyons**.
## Lyons
The most recent of the native gods of Tawdyrge, the Lyons encourage craftmanship, masonry and architecture. As gods of spectacle and beautiful living, they merge the **Gelwaréan** appreciation of nature with the fervent love of craft fostered by the industrious gods of **Larewes**. Followers ideally engage in the honing of their own artistic talents, speech and betterment of the soul, though the seed of luxury has also fostered a deep greed and insecurity amongst its worshipers.

The temples of Lyons are whole cities, their names and images are carved as frescoes upon the very walls. Shrines honouring their grace are constructed into public houses and streets. Vigils and feasts in celebration to them coincide with the completion of grand architectural projects. As such, their worship is uniquely urban.

The principle gods of Lyons are **Lugus**, and his wife, **Leiden**. They are followed by their many children. Following these are the deified cities built in honour of Lyons.
- **Lugus**, patriarchal god of walls, masonry, and protection. 
- **Leiden**, wife of Lugus. Goddess of sculpture, carving, and beauty. 
- **Natron**, goddess of glass, truth, and children.
- **Sigillata**, goddess of pottery, farmland and peace.
- **Aceris**, god of timber and shipbuilding.
- **Aes**, god of metallurgy and temperance.
- **Vetus**, goddess of sanitation, purity, and medicine.
- **Marcia**, god of contraptions, measurements, and time.
- **Pozzo**, god of cement, history and writing.
- **Iter**, god of roads, bridges, trade and messages.
