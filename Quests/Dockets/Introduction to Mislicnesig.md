Welcome to [[Mislicnesig]], a campaign grounded in folklore from the British Isles. The campaign is set in a high-fantasy, low-technology setting, with pockets of civilization dotted around a rural setting full of competing magical energies. Religion and [[Fairyland]] take major roles in this world, with gods and fairies frequently meddling in mortal affairs. 

# The State of The World
Tacking (sailing against the wind) is yet to be invented, making sea travel dangerous and at the mercy of the weather. As such, [[Mislicnesig]]'s links to the mainland are few and furious: Mortals and Gods both wish to keep their lands safe from external conquest. There are some exceptions: Mighty dragons and their kin have emigrated from far-off lands, and foreign missionaries occasionally risk setting foot on these hostile shores, hoping to spread word of some distant god.

# The State of [[Mislicnesig]]
This land was once unified under a single banner - that of *[[The Starlit Prince]]*, who founded the capital of *[[Aloghsterre]]* and brought peace and prosperity to a squabbling land. He ratified the noble families by gifting them rings of *[[Signetstone]]*, a rare stone rumoured to be from [[Fairyland]] - without such a ring, a noble family was considered illegitimate. After a period of great growth and civilization, however, the prince disappeared, leaving his glass throne shattered on the floor of his palace, *Wag Gleomu*. Noble families broke into war over the remaining [[Signetstone]] that lined the walls of his throne room, and the land remains fractured amongst warring nobility, even after all these centuries.

Nowadays, the land is split into ten kingdoms, each lying on an uneasy bedrock of brittle alliances and dubious aristocracy.
- **[[Aloghsterre]]**, an agricultural land to the east. Home of the capital. A thriving and verdant land dominated by the vast forest of *Went*
- **[[Attermoor]]**, a swampy moorland. To the west is *The [[Bletch]]*, a vile swamp and the birthplace of *Green [[Dragonborn]]*.
- **[[Banofdune]]**, a harsh heath dominated by mountains in the northeast. An abundance of valuable minerals have helped the underground folk here grow rich.
- **[[Dasheal]]**, a twisting, overgrown labyrinth of caves and rivers. Impossible to navigate without a guide.
- **[[Dederlic]]**, a rolling downland marked with flat hills and low valleys. Warring forces in the west have prompted an exodus of refugees towards the east.
- **[[Kitterland]]**, a dangerous western frontier, split between wetland and mesa. Home to varied fauna and rough towns. Merchant explorers are attempting to resettle this bountiful land.
- **[[Folahethe]]**, a rich prairie. The local birthplace of horse-riding.
- **[[Losian]]**, a lush forested region shadowed by the looming presence of *[[Ganmarn]] Peaks*. Little in the way of agriculture is practiced here.
- **[[Oferlecgan]]**, a harsh, barren tundra to the north-west. Those who dwell in the mountains of *[[Eotenset]]* have not been heard from in years.
- **[[Tawdyrge]]**, a vast, southern barony made up of fertile farmland. A confusing system of lordship leads to tension between its great manors. The great forest of *Carevessa* lies to the east.

# The State of [[Fairyland]]
[[Mislicnesig]] and [[Fairyland]] uphold a bitter rivalry following wars in the distance past. fairies are elusive troublemakers, and lack logic. The world is littered with remote places where the boundaries between the two worlds wear thin, and external influences bleed through. fairies have their own kingdoms and political structure that remain a mystery to those unacquainted. 

# The State of Religion
Everyone in [[Mislicnesig]] is religious - heavenly beings constantly meddle in mortal affairs, and enact their great schemes through their followers. Gods and devils share pantheons, and rely on the belief of mortals to give them sustenance. Without faith, a god ceases to be. Temples act as a way of solidifying faith, and the sacking of a temple is seen as an act of war.

Clerics and Warlocks both draw on the same font of religious power, and are treated of equal import by the gods. While clerics seek power in exchange for spreading faith, warlocks bargain for power with more tangible goods. 

Many gods are localized, but some have a kingdom wide presence:
- **[[The Starlit Prince]]**, a god of unity and diplomacy, who remains worshipped as a deity long after his physical disappearance. 
- **[[Marin]]**, a goddess of the winds, revered by sailors.
- **[[The Five Mothers]]**, a group of druidic fertility gods.
- **[[Larewes]]**, a varied pantheon of trade and commerce.
- **[[Ndjell]]**, an amorous god of love and envy.

For the most part, however, different regions play home to dozens of different gods. *Small Gods* are those gods whose temples outlast their followers. They are trapped, powerless in their crumbling shrines, desperately begging for faith.

# The State of the party
You are all to meet at *[[Oakenhead]]*, a small village on the road between *[[Aloghsterre]]* and the coastal town of *[[Aberfwyn]]*. There is an agricultural fair and festival at the village, accompanied by a banquet. This festival isn't famous, but you might've heard of it from a local, a tourist, or simply stumbled upon it on the way to somewhere nearby
