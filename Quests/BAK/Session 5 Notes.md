The party met Ness, a painter and a drow who was painting a caged god, thoth. They went to goblin university to try find a signpost.

They met margie, the secetary of GU, and gary, head of the Redrocks frat. They told the uni they were enrolling but needed to go to the bank first to enroll. 

They found the plaque denoting the final resting place of Thoth, the old god in the cage. They are hoping the signposts to Larlen, Aloghsterre and Aberfwyn will be put together and show them the way.
