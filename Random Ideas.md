# Laughing Tam

## Colour Thief
A brightly coloured (almost too brightly, like the saturation is turned up just for him) gentleman who's clothes are otherwise very plain, yet he speaks and introduces himself in such a frumpy manner. He travels with a companion, a quiet noblewoman dressed in drab but exceedingly high quality clothes, jewels, well styled hair - all of which seem washed out of colour. She is silent, and is introduced as a mute. The first will introduce them both and request assistance in finding the next in, eventually settling to camp a ways from the side of the road. As they drink, his voice returns to a gruffer, more masculine and common one, and as they eventually settle down to sleep, the party wake to find him gone, alongside one of the party's colours and voice. He has been travelling around like so, collecting the voices and colours of people, the drab dandy he travelled with was one such victim, and pursued him in the promise of what was stolen being returned in the event of the next theft. Perhaps in their speaking, assistance can be gained...

# Harmless bandits
- A group of harmless bandits who rob without murdering and don't always take all the treasure
- The town constable won't allow them to be killed - a town has bandits no matter what, but their presence deters a worse threat from moving in
- They have, however, robbed a caravan of alchemical supplies. This is high profile loot, and requires a significant contact to move, but can make a lot of profit. The constable wants these stolen back, he fears that the contacts could realize how harmless "Percival's kid's lot" actually are and dispatch a scarier band of ruffians to accost the town in their stead.
