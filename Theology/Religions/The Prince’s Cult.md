* Worshippers of a deified version of [[The Prince Under Starlight]], believing he shall one day return and reunite the kingdom of [[Mislicnesig]].
* Though much of the following centres in [[Aloghsterre]], [[Stewards]] make no attempt to crush it, and some have even believed in it themselves.
	* The position of steward is some birthright, and they fear losing grip on what little power they would have should they forsake [[The Prince Under Starlight]].
	* Besides, each of the inhabitants of [[Mislicnesig]] holds some hope their prince shall one day return.
* Many followers have been driven to dissent and protest following the insulation of [[Aloghsterre]] and in turn [[The Three Colleges]], which they see (perhaps not incorrectly) as direct contradiction of [[The Prince Under Starlight]]'s will.
