* When a [[Theology]] is forced to live on only [[Artefact Faith]], such as when all of its followers are dead, it becomes a Small God
* These can exert almost no power, and have not enough faith to support a plane, existing only as their avatars, cast out from their own holy kingdoms
* They are confined to the places where their belief is strongest: Temples and select holy sites
* These sites become Sitting Houses, where old gods come to slowly fade
