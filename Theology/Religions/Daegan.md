* The secret god, Daeganâ€™s followers leave prayer hidden in ciphers in the backs of books, hold communion alone in clandestine places and light candles in the solitary corners of the world.
* No worshipper of Daegan reveals their allegiance, some claiming fellowship with other faiths, or even calling themselves atheists.
* Even the followers of Daegan scarcely communicate, aside from in the encrypted messages they leave.
* His followers make no physical sacrifice, instead offering knowledge and spycraft to the god himself, acting as his eyes and ears across the world, to make up for the fact he holds no public clergy.
* Daegan in return grants his followers with esoteric knowledge, hard-to-decipher omens, and assistance when ruminating on puzzles.
* None are too sure how old Daegan is, and a frightful few know of his existence at all, even among other gods.
* There are no temples to Daegan, what little [[Artefact Faith]] he holds lies in the hidden messages and runes across the land. To quell the hidden winds of Daegan would be a tall order indeed.
