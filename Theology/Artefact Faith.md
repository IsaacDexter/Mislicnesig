* Belief born of the inanimate is known as artefact faith, and objects that give rise to such belief include relics and temples.
* They do not technically have to be temples - churches, statues, graveyards and tombs all act the same when it comes to amplifying belief.
* These artefacts act as both amplifying antennae and batteries - transmitting belief with more power, and storing it for longer after belief starts to wane.
* The strength of artefact faith is borne not of the intricacy and size of the temple, but the effort and sacrifice that went towards its construction.
* Powerful artefacts can store faith long after follower-faith has vanished, hence the importance of torching holy sites during religious conquest: banishment to the fate of the [[Small Gods]] is in some ways worse than death for a god, but it can give opportunity for that god to one day rise again.

## Sitting Houses
* Old Temples that hold the last vestiges of belief in one of the [[Small Gods]]
* [[Small Gods]] sit here and fade over the course of many years, until their Sitting Houses are destroyed
* Some faiths respect the [[Small Gods]], and bring them offerings to stop them truly blinking out
