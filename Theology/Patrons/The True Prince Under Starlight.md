* [[The True Prince Under Starlight]]'s true self following his disappearance.
* The deified prince worshipped by [[The Princeâ€™s Cult]] (and, to an extent, [[The Revenant]]) are deities born of the belief in the perceptions of who [[The Prince Under Starlight]] was, this is the actual Prince-turned-king, following his departure from the realms.
* Warlocks serving him ([[Starlit Servants]]) move in secrecy and are almost entirely unknown - there are very few in existence, and his patronage is only offered to those that have showed themselves as both exceptionally powerful and noble .
* They aid The Prince in his eternal mission of defending the realm from the conquests of the [[Unseen]] - the ultimate goal is that of impenetrable magical defences that will last till the end of time. This is not a rushed task - The Prince made himself immortal, and performs his task slowly.
* Those in his patronage are tasked with hunting those in the patronage of the [[Unseen]], as well as assisting in his laborious magic to fortify the defences. They move in secrecy and are scarcely seen.
* The Prince misses his rule of his land, and occasionally visits in a disguised corporeal form, but never intervenes as his task is too great and he can afford no distractions.
* Once his monumental task is complete, he will return to his throne of glass and rule his kingdom once more
