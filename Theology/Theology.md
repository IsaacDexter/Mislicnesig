- Peoples’ belief in a theology, be it that of a single god; a deified mortal; or entire pantheons, gives rise to a new divine plane.
- All facets of a belief lie within this plane, which in turn lies within the all-encompassing realm of reality and divinity (the only thing known of that exists outside of this realm are the [[Unseen]]).
- This includes elements of a belief that aren't worshipped but are observed, such as adversaries of the gods, underworlds, devils.
- Theologies containing and afterlife will take on the souls of their believers upon death, to exist in the afterlife as believed.
- Theologies with a belief in reincarnation will have their followers souls to be judged and processed, before being restored in the material plane.
- Similar theologies and changes in belief shape the single divine realm accordingly - there is some leniency involving misinterpretation.
- A full shift in belief, however, or enough separation between interpretation, can give rise to multiple similar theologies, which often ally.
- Different theologies can interact either in other divine planes, or through avatars in the world.
- Belief is shared throughout the theology, as it is the theology that is given power, not the god. As such, devils and adversaries in powerful theologies are equally powerful despite not being specifically worshipped, or lesser gods within a pantheon without many followers will not dwindle unless belief of their existence or role within the pantheon shifts.
- As belief is gained, theologies gain more power - their gods can enact more miracles in the mortal plane, grant more powers to their servants and appear as avatars more often.
- As belief is lost, however, the realms dwindle and they begin to lose their impact in the realm, achieving only infrequent, small miracles. They also become desperate, their miracles often aimed solely at gaining followers to restore their strength.
- Without belief, theologies turn to embers and eventually fade away, without a resurgence in belief.
- Tiny amounts of belief can live on through through the inanimate - preservation of temples, either through continued humanoid efforts or through powerful incantations. This is known as [[Artefact Faith]].
- Mighty temples which still stand after the religion has been forgotten act as Sitting Houses for the gods they once worshipped, now reduced to [[Small Gods]].
- Certain theologies have survived since before the [[Reign of Starlight]], but many were born after through desperation for belief.

## Gods
* Gods either inhabit pantheons, or exist alone in their realm.
- They are ultimately facets of a single [[theology]], rather than existing alone.
- They have will within the confines of their belief, and act accordingly to how the followers would expect - if a god were to deviate too much from how they are believed to act, they may fragment from its own [[theology]], and die without followers, with the original [[theology]] replacing them with a new facet of itself.
* It is the gods who use their portion of the theologies power to grant miracles in the materials plain, to grant prayer or to enact their will.
* They can appear as avatars in the material plane and attempt to achieve their will in this way also.

## Pantheons
- When a belief consists of multiple gods interacting with each other without necessarily sharing goals gives rise to a pantheon.
- This is a collection of gods who are all facets of one [[theology]].
- They technically share a single realm, though it may appear to be multiple realms.
- A [[theology]] does not have one shared goal necessarily - two gods in one pantheon can guide their followers differently.

## Deities
* Deities are gods, and subsequently theologies, that form out of belief for what was once a mortal being - often in death but sometimes while they are still alive.
* They are not the same as their mortal counterparts, though believe themselves to be.
* They may not act accordingly to how their mortal counterparts would have, rather according to how their followers believe they would act.
* They are gods now as any other, but often do not have full theologies to surround them - they live in empty realms, existing mostly as an avatar.
* Multiple deities can exist from one mortal, if the interpretations of who they once were/are now are distinct enough.
* Some deities exist of [[The Prince under Starlight]], who exist separate to [[The True Prince Under Starlight]], and do not necessarily know of his continued existence, instead following the believed goals of how he behaved in life and where they think he went, as opposed to his true quest.
* The cult that gave rise to the grave plane were borne of misinterpretations of the cult’s leader, semantic inconsistencies and half-baked set of beliefs, hence the inherent problems and mismanagement of this halfway-afterlife where spirits and not souls are meant to be laid to rest: which in turn leads to the player characters’ rebirth after their souls are incorrectly separated from their spirits.

## Planes
* Gods and Pantheons need a holy domain to inhabit - these are yet another facet of the collection of belief energy that in effect is the theology.
* These contain all of the domains within the theology, simply giving the appearance of a split between - while most gods perceive these as separate planes, certain older gods understand the nature of belief to a greater extent, but are usually very secretive of this knowledge: the more other gods understand, the greater risk they put to their own belief.
* These planes aren’t simply part of the gods perceptions, and do have a physical form.
* Player characters can visit these planes through an invitation from its inhabitants; meeting the criteria for it as an afterlife; or perhaps from powerful magic.
* These planes are formed and die with the theologies - they are never left empty or abandoned, and often shrink with faith.
* Souls at peace within an afterlife that begins to wane will be used as a finite source of belief energy for the god to use on the last of its miracles in the material plane before sputtering out - as such their energy is ultimately returned to the material plane through the gods’ unavoidable desperation.
